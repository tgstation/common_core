Ethereals are a humanoid, organic species originally found on the green planet Gaia. After researchers made first contact with them, they started calling them Ethereals. Due to their heavenly and celestial appearance. This name stuck and even the Ethereals themselves accepted the name.

When they were first found, the Ethereals showed the capability to harness the electricity found inside their blood. However, the race was only in an early-medieval stage of its growth, and as such was not yet able to use it in many useful ways.

# Biology

Although scientists were originally baffled by the biology of these creatures, surprisingly enough their biology is not too far off from our own. The Ethereals have translucent flesh and skin throughout their body, filled with something that essentially account to their version of blood. This blood however, posseses electrical properties that keeps the Ethereal going. For this exact reason they also need to keep themselves charged by consuming things with electric charge, or come in contact with other electrically charged things. The brighter an Ethereal shines, the more healthy of a state it is in.

One of the more unique aspects of Ethereals however, is how they create offspring. To do this they collect the stomach of a deceased Ethereal, which in their case is a form of charge-holding prism, and cover it in biological matter. After doing this they come together in some form of ritual and use their collective charge to turn the stomach into a cocoon. Although original studies thought this was a form of full-conscious reincarnation, the new Ethereal does not actually keep any of the traits of the previous Ethereal.

## Castes

Due to the more ancient society Ethereals used to live in, and their capability to harness electricity, they evolved to harness their powers in specific ways relevant to what jobs they performed. These jobs turned into castes and currently there are 4 known types of Ethereals:

### Nurturers
This caste is known for its care of people, they are more focused on saving lives than taking them, and are able to use their hands to send controlled shocks into other creatures to do things such as restarting hearts.

### Laborers
This caste is known for its care of progress, they focus on ensuring society's base needs. Their body allows them to charge their tools by using their internal charge, allowing them to work efficiently.

### Artists
This caste is one of the smallest, and focus on the arts and crafts. This caste started forming once Ethereals started integrating into NanoTrasen, and have the ability to create songs and pieces of art that instill feelings of joy in anyone who witnesses them.

### Soldiers
This caste focuses on protection and preservation. This caste's purpose is to protect their homeworld from outsiders. And they want to preserve their planet only for those born on it. They are the only caste that refused to join Nanotrasen, and even threatened to attack them for coming to their world.

# Reception
As Ethereals went through classes to make them able to live in the modern world, they were also introduced to various stations and installations owned by Nanotrasen. Initial reactions ranged from shocked to awed. With some of the Ethereals offering to help with simple electrical repairs as soon as they arrived. However, some were not keen with the amount of luminosity the Ethereals provided, and one was reported saying "Can someone turn off this fucking lightbulb?"
