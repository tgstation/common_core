# Bestiary of Sprout

Even on a galactic scale, Sprout's fauna is particularly bizarre, beautiful and dangerous. Here are some of the peculiar species that have caught the interest of those who braved its wilds.

### Volthound

>"It's not my volthound, it's my associate."
-Kepler XVI, Trailwarden

Danger Level: Medium
Average Size: 120 cm (height)
Average Weight: 180 Kg
Diet: Omnivore

One of the most well known of Sprout's fauna, Volthounds are remarkably intelligent and social pack hunters commonly found both in the wild and domesticated for hunting and defending settlements from wildlife. Despite sharing much of their appearance with that of a canid with slender long legs and shaggy dark grey fur, their abilities are anything but ordinary. They can raise the white bristling quills on their backs and make them vibrate, rubbing against each other with enough speed to create static electricity strong enough to stun small prey or deter predators.

They are usually found in plains or more sparse forest as their fast running speed is less suitable for the more cramped underbrush of the rainforest and they are also not particularly adept at climbing trees compared to most local species.

Although they do not usually hunt human sized prey, a hungry Volthound or a large enough pack may see a lone traveler as a tempting target. The most effective way to guarantee safety against Volthound attacks is to never travel alone, as attacks against groups are almost unheard of.

### Coilsnake

Danger Level: Low
Average Size: 60 cm (lenght)
Average Weight: 150 g
Diet: Carnivore, mostly insects and small fish

A small semi-aquatic snake, easily identified by the bright flashes and electric cracking noise it makes as it darts across the water's surface. Although their electric discharge isn't strong enough to be a danger to anything human-sized, they tend to swarm potential prey in great numbers, making a rather unpleasant experience for anyone unlucky or foolish enough to find themselves in infested waters.

Coilsnakes prefer to live in the damp and swampy underbrush of the deep rainforest, although they can be found almost anywhere near a body of water, in fewer numbers. They prefer to stay in the water but can survive on land indefinitely should they find themselves stranded due to changes in water levels.


### Beast of Hooto

Danger Level: Medium
Average Size: 2 m (height)
Average Weight: 250 Kg
Diet: Herbivore

The name of the Beast of Hooto might in fact be its most known feature to human society, originating from its owl-like calls and the story of its first encounter: some of the survivors of the crash that led to the uplifting would accidentally make camp under its nesting tree and be awoken at night by the beast wrecking havoc in their camp, causing destruction of equipment and terrifying the hapless survivors. 
The story quickly became a global sensation as people speculated what kind of monster was lurking in the dark forests of Sprout and it would be a week before someone could spot it at the light of day. To the disappointment of many, the supposed ferocious predator was instead a rather funny looking, fat, teal colored hamster with a birdlike beak. 
The name stuck regardless, and although the Hooto is neither particularly aggressive or ferocious, the giant claws it uses to climb trees also make formidable weapons.

The Hooto is mostly arboreal and rarely remains on the ground for extended amounts of time. Despite it's physique it is fast and agile, able to climb and jump across trees with surprising dexterity. Although not aggressive by nature they are somewhat territorial and will give warnings to leave its territory with its loud cries. 
On rare occasions when their homes are comprompromised the Hooto may be forced to travel on the ground due to a lack of trees to climb across. In this distressed state, the Hooto becomes much more aggressive and dangerous.

Hootos are occasionally tamed as mounts to traverse the deep rainforest, though actually riding them requires a lot of practice and a strong stomach, as the rider needs to constantly adjust its position depending on the Hooto's orientation as it climbs and jumps across the tree canopies, sometimes even upside down! This mode of travel is anything but comfortable yet one of the fastest ways to move across the overgrown deep rainforest, so it's usually only employed by trailwardens or seasoned outdoorsmen.

### Dweller

>"During one of our excursions outside the village, I must admit, I made the mistake of wandering off a little too far from our group, distracted by a type of flower I had not seen before. I was so lost in my thoughts that I did not even notice Kepler approaching before abruptly yanking me back onto the trail. Rude, I thought to myself! But I did not have time to voice my displeasure before I noticed the rock I was standing right in front of had eyes, and it was staring right at me."
-"The Tourist's Survival Guide to Sprout", Vedika Bakshi

Danger Level: Variable
Average Size: 25 m (lenght), 10 m (height)
Average Weight: 40 tons (estimated)
Diet: Omnivore

Appearing as something of a mix between a salamander and a toad, with six short legs, stocky body and tail all covered in rock solid scales, these beasts can reach lenghts of over twenty meters and yet remain one of the most elusive species on the planet. Dwellers spend most of their life completely immobile, absorbing what little nutriment they need to survive in their vegetative state through skin contact with the ground and the layers of dirt and flora that inevitably starts covering their backs, acting as the perfect camouflage.
Dwellers tend to become less and less active as they age, so much so in fact, that some of the oldest known specimens have remained immobile since the day they were discovered and are now treated as landmarks. Stories of ethereals unwittingly building their houses on the backs of Dwellers are not unheard of, as layers of dirt and plant life can make them impossible to spot without careful surveying.
One of the possible telltale signs of a recently relocated Dweller is the appearance of plant life not native to an area, as dwellers move from one place to another carrying the plants on their backs.

If there's such a thing as a sacred animal for the ethereals that'd be the Dwellers. Their positions are carefully monitored by the local trailwardens and hunting them is strictly prohibited, although not many would be foolish enough to try: their extremely thick skin is almost impossible to pierce with conventional weapons and their tail swipes are strong enough to topple trees. They can run with surprising speed when needed, leaving destruction in their wake due to their size.
They are a common appearance in ethereal mythology. Some of the popular myth surrounding them mention the existence of "crystal dwellers", an even bigger variant with crystals growing on their backs that reside in huge underground caves spanning the entire planet, others speak of Sprout itself being a planet-sized, dormant dweller.

Although they are omnivores they do not actively hunt for anything that wouldn't unwittingly climb into their mouth. They are harmless when left undisturbed and usually ignore the presence of humans. Their eyesight and earing is rather poor, but they are very sensitive to vibrations, making them able to sense movement with incredible precision.

How the Dwellers evolved into this extreme form of mimicry isn't clear as their size means they have no natural predators. They are thought to be the oldest surviving species on the planet, and one can only speculate on what kind of enormous creatures they outlived.

"Lesser Dwellers" are often confused for juveniles but are in fact a different species which can reach a maximum size of two meters in lenght. They are far more active than their larger counterpart and are sometimes kept as communal village pets.

### Moondrifter

Danger Level: High
Average Size: 40 cm (width)
Average Weight: Undetermined
Diet: Carnivore

This glowing jellyfish-like creature is able to freely float in Sprout's atmosphere thanks to it's lighter-than-air weight. They mainly feed on insects attracted by the bright light they emanate, discharging a strong electric shock on contact while entangling them with their tentacles.

Moondrifters can be found all over Sprout's sky, either in big swarms high up in the sky or in small groups under the tree canopies of the rainforest.

Swarms of Moondrifters are said to be as beautiful against the night sky as they are dangerous: those who wish to enjoy the spectacle should make sure to only do from a safe location or ensure the presence of good weather as their weight makes them particularly susceptible to being blown around by the wind in unpredictable ways. Although they are not directly hostile, proximity to Moondrifters should be avoided at all costs as direct contact can cause severe injury or even death.

Moondrifter skin is highly sought after for its extreme conductive properties and it's glistening appearance makes it a popular choice for luxury clothing.

### Gutterpede

>"The most punctual public transport I've ever been on, and not the worst smelling either!"
-"The Tourist's Survival Guide to Sprout", Vedika Bakshi

Danger Level: Minimal
Average Size: 8 m (lenght), 2 m (height)
Average Weight: 300 kg
Diet: Herbivore

A long and rather flat centipede composed of several jointed rings each with two long but rather dull spikes facing upward that they use as deterrents against predators.
Despite it's less than flattering name and intimidating appearance, Gutterpedes are rather docile and helpful creatures: occasionally called "commuters" for the peculiar way in which they follow a very strict schedule of rotating their grazing spots once a day, always moving inbetween them through a circuit of routes called "gutters", "trenches" or "highways" slowly eroded into the ground by their daily routine. These gutters vary in depth depth depending on how long they've been used, ranging from a few centimeters to a couple of meters in the most extreme cases.
Thanks to their habitual nature and an indifferent disposition towards most other creatures, ethereals realized Gutterpedes could be mounted in the wild to conveniently and consistently travel across large distances. Any attempt at controlling their movements has failed as Gutterpedes simply end up abandoning their trenches when any man-made alterations are made to try and coax them into different taking directions, so those who are looking to make use of them have to rely on preexisting natural routes.

Gutterpedes live in herds of 20 to 50 and tend to evenly divide themselves among the available grazing spots in a constant rotation across their circuit of trenches. They tend to stick around open plains and only occasionally make routes across the rainforest.

Just about the only way to make a wild Gutterpede acknowledge one's presence is to stand in their way: the Gutterpede may appear confused for a time for having its route blocked, after which it will attemp to remove the blockage by grabbing it with their front mandibles and throwing it out of the gutter before continuing on its way.
This became something of a popular dare among tourists for a time until measures had to be taken to crack down on this practice, and attempting to do so is a sure way to make the local guides very angry.

Hunting Gutterpedes is forbidden without specific permission, as any disturbance poses the risk of them abandoning their routes and the subsequent destruction of useful logistical connections.

Although wild Gutterpedes can't be domesticated, those raised in captivity never develop their traveling instinct despite countless attempts at training them. They make excellent mounts or pack animals however, not quite as fast as many other domesticated species, but seemingly tireless and able to carry and incredible amount of weight.
Gutterpede ranches require very large grazing grounds, so they are only a viable option for larger settlements based in the plains.
