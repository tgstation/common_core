## Life Cycle

Moths, as you might expect from an exoskeletal invertebrate, go through several different life stages before being considered adults. 
A moth is born in a clutch of three to five eggs and raised in a creche alongside any other children on the ship. A newborn moth is a grub the size of a human infant with six limbs used for mobility and a front pair with crude graspers which can manipulate small objects.  

Moth grubs spend 2-3 years in this shape, during which they eat as frequently as possible and grow rapidly to try to achieve the bulk they will need to transform into an adult. Moth grubs instinctually try to spend their time in warm, confined spaces and so an appropriate environment and supervision is usually required to prevent them from wandering off into vents.  

Despite their appearance, these grubs are actually no less sapient than a roughly equivalently aged human child and reach several developmental milestones more quickly. Their care is considered to be an extremely important position in Moth society: the future of each ship in the fleet depends on it. Usually they are taught a form of sign language compatible with both Moth and Grub limbs at as early a juncture as possible so that they can make their needs known, as they lack the vocal chords to make any kind of intelligible speech. 

After reaching an appropriate size a Moth grub will spin a coccoon in what it feels is a secure area (adults in the fleet try to provide various appropriate receptacles for this such that they don't try to pupate in inconvenient locations) and dissolve their own bodies over a period of a month, reconfiguring into their mature shape.  

An interesting quirk of Moth biology is that almost the entire brain is reconfigured during this process and childhood is largely only remembered as a series of vague impressions; while Moth grubs are intelligent enough to be taught language and mathematics they will not remember any skill they had during childhood after their pupation and so further education before this point is not usually considered to be particularly worthwhile. Moth caretakers, despite probably knowing grubsign at some point in their infancy, generally need to relearn it agian as adults from the other side.  

Post-pupation moths begin a series of yearly moults where they shed their entire exoskeleton in order to grow to an adult height, and during this period they will also receive an education. Young moths are taught collectively in ship-wide schools (or communte to other ships with better facilities in the case of the smallest ships) and eventually graduate towards an apprenticeship under another experienced Moth after shipboard leadership have evaluated each in terms of their professional skills. Teaching is *also* considered quite a prestigious career path, and is quite a difficult position to qualify for (on a similar level to ship navigators or command-level staff). 
Usually by the time they have finished moulting for good and reached their final height, a Moth will also be ready to enter the adult world. Failure to be fit for any particular independent duty by this time is considered a cultural sign of failure as an individual, but also for the people who were tasked with that Moth's education.

On very rare occasions a grub will fail to pupate at all and will simply continue growing as a grub. This is actually less of an impediment to life than you might expect, as the close quarters of ships are reasonably easy for a grub to navigate, and their *cognitive* development continues to the extent that an adult grub can be a fully participating member of shipboard life, often employed themselves in tasks such as care or education of other Grubs, maintenance of devices that favour their smaller limbs and frames, or nonphysical managerial and command positions.
The Fleet needs every available hand to contribute, and so simply doesn't have the luxury of turning down an appropriate mind even if it has an inconvenient body.

## Family

The smallest family unit within the Mothic Fleet is the ship. Everyone on board your ship is your family and everyone is expected to pull together to support their family. Moth children are raised knowing every adult as a parent and every other child as a sibling, with a similarly strong taboo against *having* children with other people who were born on your ship.

Adolescent Moths then are often expected to journey to *other* ships to work for a time, sending resources back home to their family, and then ideally to *return with a spouse*. Managing to bring a valuable worker with rare skills home with you is a mark of a very successful Moth and greatly celebrated, or the same to entice someone to decide *not* to return home and instead set up permanent residence upon your own vessel. 
These complex webs of immigrant relationships between parts of the fleet can lead to long term loyalties and rivalries that people from outside often find hard to follow or comprehend, making Moth Fleet dramas somewhat unpopular with any other species.

This principle is additionally stretched a little upon the largest capital ships which can house thousands of inhabitants, but these tend to cope by subdividing themselves into smaller "ships" which more accurately represent departments and subdivisions where the majority of adults work and sleep.

## Outside the Fleet

While the much smaller family units employed by humanity can come as a bit of a shock to Grand Fleet Moths (and often create comical misunderstandings) it also plays some part in their good reputation outside of their own spaces.
Moths who travel outside of their home ship to another are essentially expected to treat wherever they end up as a *second* family, and resultingly to try and get along with everyone there in case they decide to stay, and this amicable instinct tends to make them quite good house guests.

To a traditional Moth raised among other Moths, the entire crew of a space station you work on might be under evaluation to become your new parents and siblings, and so should be treated well. Unfortunately this can also leave  Moths in crews without other Moths feeling lonely and left-out, as their Human coworkers rarely return what they feel is an appropriate level of closeness in kind.
