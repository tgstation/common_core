Despite its days as a purely military organization being well in the past, the fleet still clings to its hierarchical structure. However the long term logistical challenges of maintaining its ever increasing population required adapting to a more flexible approach than the classic chain of command. The fleet is now divided into several divisions, each with a distinctive role and ranking structure, each still under direct control of the Junta.

Each crew consists, at minimum, of one member from each division. Furthermore, crew composition may come in two different types:
- Generalist crews are a varied mix of divisions and are able to fulfill multiple roles. Assignments for generalist crews are typically more open-ended and may include a mix of trading, exploration and salvaging, depending on the present needs and opportunities.
- Specialist crews consist of an overwhelming majority from a particular division. Vessels with this designation may have very specific tasks related to their division, such as hydroponics farming, manufacturing, shipbuilding, etcetera.

Most divisions do not have strict uniform policies, instead making use of patches sewn onto work clothes or armbands to display rank and role.


### Vanguard Corps (VC)

The upper echelon and de facto military component of the Fleet, the Vanguard stands directly under the Junta in the chain of command.

Unlike the rest of the fleet, Vanguard-specific vessels are not mixed with other divisions. Its members are handpicked from the best that the fleet has to offer, who will in turn fill the role of commanding officers when assigned to mixed crews.

The VC's main tasks are forward scouting and the defence of the fleet. Their equipment is top of the line and always kept in perfect shape.
It is the only division on the fleet with a strict uniform consisting of a dark grey boiler suit, or white for officers.

It has the smallest number of active servicemen during peace time compared to other divisions, although any and all members of the fleet may be conscripted to fight at any time if required. Preparing for the Vanguard's call is part of any young moth's training process.

### Engineering Support Unit (ESU)

The ESU is in charge of maintenance of existing ships, construction of new ones, and the decommissioning of old vessels. On occasion, their missions may also involve outpost construction, mining and salvaging operations. Beyond maintenance, their personal tasks also include piloting and navigation.

Despite having no uniforms, engineering crew are easy to spot thanks to their flightsuits: a special harness designed to protect their rather cumbersome wings and keep them safe from all the sparking, scorching and moving parts of engine rooms. Few dare to work without them, and fewer manage to not regret it.

### Procurement Division (PD)

The Procurement Division has the gargantuan task of maintaining the fleet supplied with everything it needs from spare parts to food and anything inbetween. It is the second largest division in the fleet. Their assignments include all parts of the process from production to manufacturing and distribution. 
Anything that can't be produced from within the fleet is traded for from outside sources. Trading missions are frequent and the most likely reason their vessels can be found in settled systems far away from the main fleet.

There are also rumors that the PD is responsible for the occasionally less than legal appropriation of resources through piracy. Unfounded hearsay of course, they would say.

### Fleet Authority (FA)

The Fleet Authority keeps the peace aboard the fleet and determining disciplinary actions for lawbreakers. They possess legislative, executive, and judicial power and their ranks go all the way from the equivalents of a beat cop to a judge. 
A rather controversial organization for outsiders, the FA is often described as unjust and fickle among fleet exiles, more intent on working for the fleet's interests than serving justice. Still, perhaps also due to its reputation, the FA is relatively successful at keeping the peace.

Commonly called "White Hats" for their recognizable helmets, they operate primarily aboard city-ships where drunken brawls and petty disputes are par for the course. Smaller vessels typically only have a single disciplinary officer on board, who is also in charge of communications and sending status reports to higher command.

### Standard Upkeep (SU)

Widely considered to be the "civilian" section of the fleet, the Standard Upkeep division accounts for nearly two third thirds of the fleet's population. Its mission is to maintain the quality of life of all crewmembers and it casts a very wide net while doing so: from basic needs such as medical and mealmaking to janitorial duties and entertainment. In short: any job that does not fall into the of other divisions. 
City-ships fall under the SU's command, massive ships that can house thousands of people living a relatively relaxed life not too dissimilar from if it were on any planetside settlement.
The SU's equipment tend to be more rugged, often handed down from other divisions, and their ships bear the marks of being repaired and jury-rigged many, many times over their lifespan.
One should not mistake the SU as being of less importance or lower renown, however: among the best of the SU are people who have mastered not just one but many different professions even in entirely different fields, and their contribution to the fleet is just as important.
Most young moths will do odd jobs for the SU while growing up before officially joining other divisions depending on their aptitude, learning many different and useful skills in the process.

### Eminent Retinues

A rather recent addition to the Fleet's organization, Eminent Retinues are special groups led by one or more individuals (called Retainers) who have distinguished themselves for their leadership skills and have been sanctioned to lead their crew as they see fit, independently from the rest of the fleet. 

This status is not without its drawbacks, however: although retinues can still benefit from the fleet's support network, they are expected to be self sufficient in their day-to-day operations on top of paying a contribution based on their size. Should they fail to do so, their status would be revoked and the crew assimilated back into the regular ranks. 

As for why one would decide to follow the much more arduous path of independence, it varies. Some may see it as a matter of pride, others believe they can be more efficient in their goals unburdened by the fleet's burocracy, but this should not to taken as a lack of loyalty for the fleet.

Most retinues only account for a dozen or so members, only a handful have become big and powerful enough to have numbers over the three digits and they tend to be known by all in the fleet.
Some notable examples include:

# The Third Sunrise Pariahs

An infamous group of smugglers well known to Terragov authorities. They operate out of the famed Levante, a cargo freighter turned city-ship that offers any and all kinds of services and entertainment for locals and tourists alike.
As the group operates within the confines of the Fleet's laws by suppling third-party smugglers from within the Fleet's domain, they remain untouchable despite their presence always being followed by a notable increase in contraband across the local markets.

# Doubletime! Logistics

By far the biggest of the retinues, Doubletime is responsible for much of the trading that happens between the fleet and outsiders, as well as a being a pillar of the fleet's supply lines. 
Doubletime is so important in fact, that its continued status as an independent retinue is often called into question: while its current Retainers still remain at the helm, the Fleet's upper command has been steadily expecting more direct control and it is unlikely they would consider maintaining their status should irreconcilable disagreements arise.

# Enginmender Guild

Originally founded by a group of gifted engineers, the Enginmenders found great fortune in offering their expertise outside of the fleet through contract work. They still maintain a close relationship with the ESU, especially in the education of new recruits and the Research and Development of new technologies.

As the stories go, any Enginmender could build an entire spaceship on their own, given enough time.
