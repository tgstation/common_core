# Miscellaneous Culture of the Moths

### Names

>"Whatever."
-The first moth to be granted Terragov citizenship, Whatever, choosing their legally recognized name

Names hold significant importance within moth culture. According to folklore, names are inextricably bound to the owner, like a key to their soul that must be protected or face terrible consequences should anyone with ill intentions discover it. In more modern times, revealing one's own name has become a symbol of great personal trust. It is a matter so rarely discussed that it's not unheard of for some moths to forget their own name.

For this reason, no official name is recognized on the fleet. Every citizen is assigned an identification number that will be used for all official matters. Colloquially moths address one another in various ways such as by nickname, rank, occupation, the ship they are serving on, physical attributes or mannerisms (examples: "Stutters", "Rude Bartender", "Ship Engineer", "One-Eye Captain"). Ironically, this means moths will have not just one but several different names each depending on a specific context and you may even hear conversations between two moths talking about the same person using different names. This tends to cause confusion with outsiders, though the moths seem very well accustomed to this method, sometimes even using it with other races out of habit.

To allow identification within human society, moths are eventually required to pick their own legally recognized name. Some regard this as a meaningless formality and will pick at random, while others, seeing it as an opportunity to further exploit their amicable appearance, may choose a name that humans could find cute or amusing, much to the chagrin of the officials that have to approve the requests.

### Fleet Day and the Festival of the Errant Lights

>"You can't be lost if you don't know where to go. So follow the wind, for it knows the way."
-Old Mothic Proverb

Fleet Day, one of the most anticipated festivities of the fleet, sees all of the fleet mothkind congregate around the various capital ships for a rare day of merry leisure. It is also a rare occasion for outsiders to witness the fleet's bustling life, as during the festivities they tend to be more tolerant than usual to tourists.
Closing the festivities is the so-called Festival of the Errant Lights, a symbolic reenactment of the start of the fleet's journey towards the vast unknown. Each moth is encouraged to bring a lantern (or any other light-emitting device) which will be jettisoned out of the ship along with thousands of others. 
Although most will contribute simple lanterns, each year some of the most creative and ingenious fleet members compete to create the most beautiful and impressive lighting contraption, with competition seemingly becoming more and more fierce each year as the creators try to one-up each other.
Those lucky enough to witness the festivities are often impressed about the spectacular lightshow created by the thousands of lights drifting out into space.
Finding one of these festival lanterns out space is said to bring good luck, a rare occurrence for the fleet as they tend to not linger in the same area for long. It is, however, a sentiment rarely shared by those "lucky" enough to have the newly formed debris field smash into their hull.

### Sparkweed

>"They sure know how to throw a party, I tell ya what. The speed they go through the stuff... if you told me they needed it to survive I'd believe it. Then again, with those work hours, maybe they do."
-Testimony from a former smuggler

One of the few surviving plants originating from the moth homeworld and arguably the most obiquitous, the fleet is known to produce an enormous quantity of Sparkweed thanks to it's many uses as a recreational substance as well as the speed and ease with which it can grow in the right conditions.
It is an aquatic plant growing on a central stem with pinnate leaves and a purple-reddish color, it requires a minimum temperature of 45°C to grow and can survive up to 120°C.
The otherwise prohibitively expensive amount of heating required for any conventional hydroponic setup was no match for mothic ingenuity: by hooking up the hydroponic tanks to the to the ship engines' cooling systems, Sparkweed became nearly cost-free to produce. Even outside of dedicated hydroponic ships, some of the more enterprising captains occasionally jury-rig their own small scale production.
Sparkweed stems and leaves can be either chewed or dried and steeped in hot water, while the roots are smoked akin to a cigarette (called "Afterburners") thanks to their spongy structure acting as a natural filter.
It has a mild euphoric effect and gives a feeling of warmth. High dosage poses no particular danger, although long term excess tends to cause "the shakes", a persistent sense of anxiety and shivering. This condition can be easily remedied by stopping consumption for a few days, though it is widespread enough to have contributed to the moths' reputation of always being on edge.
What little is known about its origins has been passed through generations: it would grow exclusively in the scorching waters of volcanic geysers and was a staple for enduring the freezing temperatures of the planet's colder side.
