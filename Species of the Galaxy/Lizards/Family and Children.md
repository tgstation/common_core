# Family and Children
When Humans first encountered and clashed with Lizards and their galactic empire, there were numerous points of culture shock. One of the larger ones was about their childhoods. While all the child-rearing peoples in the known galactic sphere will champion their own methods as the best and most moral, most will also quietly agree with each other than the way Lizards treat their young is *unusually* cold-blooded.  

Humans and many other large mammals utilise a reproductive strategy where they produce a small number of children (usually one at a time) and then invest a large amount of effort and resources into raising and protecting them, but that isn't the *only* evolutionarily successful reproductive strategy. Many other animals go for a different approach; producing a very *large* number of children and investing much less into each individual one, trusting in the law of averages to preserve their genes into the future. The Lizards of Tizira are one of these species.  

## In the Past

In their evolutionary past, Lizards would form large matriarchal clans within which a small number of females would mate with multiple roving males, protect large collective clutches of eggs, and essentially leave the hatchlings to wander the clan's territory under the loose protection of their relatives, figuring out for themselves how to become a useful member of society.  
Lizard hatchlings are born significantly more independent than human babies and are able to walk at around the time they are capable of breaking out of their own eggs, but cognitive development during the first four or five years of their life is significantly slower and they rarely begin to speak until after this point. Hatchlings born at the same time instinctually form bands which wander and observe the adults, picking fights with *other* bands of children, and generally ignored by adults unless they get in the way.  

Because all children are raised communaly, there is no particular special relationship placed between "parents" and "children" and in fact parentage is not even always often very clear, inbreeding being avoided by most pairings being made from lizards from other communities. Instead, Lizards tend to have a primary close relationship to their clutchmates and a secondary one to the community they were brought up inside of.

As they age and begin to be able to express thoughts and opinions, they would generally be expected to gravitate towards adults performing interesting tasks and would pick up the ability to be helpful through observation and eventually through tuition, eventually being recognised as individuals. This developmental stage is generally accompanied by a change in scale colour from drab camoflague patterns to more vibrant ones which can be used to relate socially with other individuals.
Alternately, some children would inevitably simply wander outside the protection of the clan and disappear into the wild, an unfortunate fact of life.

Having large amounts of children was developmentally useful to Tizirans both in the past and in the present; Lizards adapt very rapidly to novel environments and are quick to recover their population from catastrophic events like wars. Some human scientists also speculate that this contributed to their Empire's drive to claim large amounts of territory through violent conflict, although that same urge is not necessarily untrue of Humans.

## In the Present

In modern times now that Lizards are no longer "merely" intelligent, roaming predator animals things cannot quite work in the same way, but the facts of their biology remain the same. Tiziran children are born in great numbers and simply not considered to be "people" until their fourth to sixth year of life, prior to which they are not _ignored_ but are not treated with the special privilege most neighbouring sapient species consider normal. The large number of Tiziran children combined with their inquisitive nature, habit of forming small gangs and fighting each other, relatively _high_ level of athleticism and ability to escape enclosed spaces, and a reduced level of parental oversight can somtimes lead to a level of pre-adulthood injury and mortality that would be worrying in many other communities.  

It isn't that a Tiziran won't _care_ if a child gets hurt, it's just that collectively they have a status closer to Humanity's "outdoor cats" (or even barn cats, as there are more commonly groups of eight of them rather than just one). It is generally understood that in order for them to grow into a properly developed adult, a hatchling needs a lot of space to wander around and figure things out for themselves alongside a lot of variouslt aged peers. Sometimes they'll get into fights with those peers. Sometimes they're just going to disappear or come back limping and you won't quite know why, and this is generally considered to be an acceptable trade for a "natural childhood". Only once they are able to look in a mirror, recognise themselves, and make this known to a guardian are they considered to have risen above this status.  
Traditional Tiziran values (though not held by all) tell them that this leads to strong children and a better species, which to critics veers close to an ideology known on Earth as "eugenics". While many other species look on these statistics judgmentally, it's unarguably true that if every Lizard child survived it would only take a few generations for them to totally outpace the capacity for their planets to provide for.  

Your average Lizard (absent influence from other cultures), when presented with the common moral choice choice between saving a mother or a child would virtually always choose the mother- an adult is simply more helpful to the greater whole and there will always be more children.  
This also leads to a somewhat uncommon attitude towards disability; Empire culture will invest significant resources into preserving and extending the lives of adults, the elderly, and those wounded in the process of performing their jobs because these people have already "passed" their genetic filter. Children born with inherited conditions though have a significant uphill battle to even survive until the point where they will have any access to these resources and experience significantly worse outcomes than among other species.  

## The Tiziran Empire

How Lizards deal with the constraints of their biology in modern times tends to be heavily dependent on their class, Empire Tizirans live in a significantly unequal and stratified society and the way that childhood is handled for the bulk of the population differs from that of the very rich and the very poor.  

The richest and most powerful lizard families still live in large (although not necessarily matriarchal) family enclaves, spreading their familial connections through society to cement their own power and keeping careful track of which young are most promising to push towards certain positions, and which would make better foot soldiers.  

For the more average Tiziran citizen, child rearing tends to be based around *neighbourhoods* rather than family-owned territories. Adult Tizirans form strong romantic and platonic bonds with multiple other adults and cohabit in shared housing with large groups of peers who are considered equivalent to a family unit, despite not being related. Geographically close groups of these large families will then pool resources towards a collective creche suitable for "free-range" childcare, ideally taking the form a central part of a Tiziran suburb which doubles as a recreational park around which residential buildings are sited which is enclosed to ensure that wandering bands of pre-adolescents don't escape into the city, though the precise logistics depend heavily on the surroundings (in dense urban environments, this may simply take the form of several reserved floors of an apartment building).  
The precise nature of how safe and enriched any youngsters here are depends significantly on the affluence of the surrounding community, but at minimum will involve the hiring or volunteer work of several keepers both to keep an eye on things (to the level that they can, being significantly outnumbered by their charges) but also ideally to provide some practical examples of useful skills for chlidren to learn from by example.  
Recent developments in remote monitoring (allowing better safety coverage of such creches via camera monitoring) has had a surprising impact on galactic culture as live streams of Tiziran children have become unexpectedly popular outside of Tiziran space amongst other species and some cannier creches have started trying to develop this as an additional source of revenue to make sure that their wards can get the best possible start in life.

Poor and rural Tizirans are forced by circumstance to live in the manner most similar to their ancestors; if there isn't a whole village with the resources to raise the children then the hatchlings will have to either be allowed to roam freely around wherever the adults live and work or an attempt made to trade off eggs to more affluent Lizards.  

A not-insignificant quantity of unwanted and unexpected eggs, or hatchlings which wander outside of anyone's particular oversight, find their way into the care of the Empire's military service which has a strong interest in replenishing the ranks following their ruinous clashes with Humanity. This both takes the form of programmes where they will simply buy eggs from people who do not feel they have the resources to ensure they are looked after any other way, as well as operating "public services" which collect unsupervised "feral" children off the street. In times of particularly strong desire for recruitment, people in poorer communities may find that all of their children are considered to be "feral" regardless of how well they are actually being looked after. 

## Outside the Empire

It is also worth noting here that significant numbers of Lizards now live far from their "Homeworld" in conditions significantly unlike those of their ancestors, in Human cities and stations. Most Lizards you might see employed on Nanotrasen research stations were probably raised under such conditions.  

Humanised Tizirans experience *significant* pressure to conform and attempt to fit themselves into what Humans consider to be a proper family; too few parents to take care of the number of children a pair of Tizirans can have. Resultingly, many adapt to this by destroying a significant amount of a clutch they have laid and then attempting to raise their more manageable number of hatchlings as a nuclear family.  

Members of other species can point at the success of these attempts and argue that the fact that it can be done means that the continuing situation around Tizira is unacceptable; in return the Tizirans would say that the number of children killed by these methods is actually much *higher*, it's simply that their detractors are drawing the arbitrary line of where personhood begins in a different place than they are.

Most human polities have accepted that Lizards under the age of 6 cannot be tutored in the same pre-school environments as human children, as it's not realistically possible to socialise them against biting people who weren't born in the same nest.

## Ashwalkers

While you would perhaps think, given their lifestyle and conditions, that Ashwalkers would represent a reversion to a tribal ancestral state... nothing could be further from the truth.  
The lifestyle of the Ashwalkers is entirely artificial and sustained totally through their interactions with the mysterious Necropolis. Ashwalkers are a single group who primarily work in service of this sinister parent, whereas if left to their own devices they would likely have formed several competing societies and spread further across the planet's surface.  

Within the enclaves of the Ashwalkers, all eggs are produced by mysterious tendrils that erupt from the ground and hatch as fully-formed, mutated Tizirans who already know several of the skills they will need in order to survive their harsh environment, as well as an instilled affection towards The Necropolis. Whether they even maintain the capability to reproduce in a more typical fashion is unknown.
