# Roleplay and Character Notes: Lizardkind

Most lizards working for Nanotrasen are likely to be Terran citizens by birth, being born to prior immigrants from the Tiziran Empire or from one of the ceded territories handed over as part of the Treaty of Atrakor. A smaller subset will be Tiziran migrants who left the empire of their own accord, either as economic migrants or having been compelled to leave due to some disagreement with Imperial policy (e.g. draft dodging, disillusionment with the government). Finally, the smallest subset will encompass citizens of independent lizard polities or true independents, who have left their homeland to come to Terran territory for one reason or another.

Working for Nanotrasen will, in most cases, necessitate Terran citizenship (these rules may bend if your character is working "off-record"). Alternatively, they may be on a work visa from their home nation.

Your cultural ties will depend on your background.

# Physical Characteristics
Size: Lizards stand a bit taller on average than humans. The average heights for Clawstriders on Tizira are 6' 5" for men, and 6' 8" for women. For Vinedwellers, the average heights are 5' 2" for men, and 5' 5" for women.
Build: Clawstrider Lizards are generally lithe and slender. They do not gain body fat easily, nor is their musculature particularly defined. Vinedwellers, on the other hand, are stockier and more well-built, with broad skeletons.

## Citizenship Type
The first step to creating a Lizard character is deciding *why* your character is in human space. As part of their origin, citizenship plays a key role.

## Citizenship from Birth (Native)
At some point in your lineage, your ancestors left behind the empire for human space. Perhaps they were economic migrants of generations gone past, enduring the hardships of emigrating between the various wars. Perhaps they were recent migrants, after the end of the final war. Perhaps they were in one of the conquered territories of the various skirmishes. Either way, you were born in human space, and that makes you a full Terran citizen by birthright.

### 

Most Terranised lizards come from the further reaches of human space. While there are significant minority populations in and around the human core, these are also where prejudice runs the deepest, and so many lizards seek to live in the more cosmopolitan rim.

When choosing to play a Terranised lizard, there are a few things to consider:
- What kind of upbringing did you have? Did your parents hold true to traditional Imperial parenting, or was your childhood closer to a typical human?
- 

As a humanised lizard, you benefit from legal protection under TerraGov law. This means that you will have had no particular barriers to education or services from a legal perspective- however, what the government can't see, it can't litigate, and given the strained relations between humans and lizards, prejudice is (unfortunately) commonly experienced by lizards residing in human space. Many lizards grow up in impoverished or deprived areas due to this. Areas further from the core tend to be more cosmopolitan, with less strain between the species.

Characters with this origin are likely to be much more human-like in mannerism. They may cling to vestiges of their mother culture- however, these may be distorted views produced by the "telephone effect" of their ancestors, and as such may cause friction with first-generation migrants who have actually lived in the motherland.
