### Peliskpalo: The Tiziran Ball Game
> "It's just not a good game unless someone breaks a rib."

Peliskpalo (Game of War) is Tizira's "national" sport, played planetwide and popular amongst lizards of all colours, creeds and regions. Originally developed as a martial training exercise in the medieval period, the game would develop throughout the ages, with a standardised ruleset coming into play, alongside tournaments, and leagues. The first professional league was founded in the midst of the Industrial Revolution in Oskmarzel, and from there the game would take the world by storm.

#### Rules:
Peliskpalo is a team ball game, played with 8 players per side. The rules are simple: get the ball to the opposing end of the court. The ball can be moved by the use of any body part, but it cannot be held in the hands, nor can it move backwards. Should the ball move backwards more than one progression line, possession is relinquished to the other team. Contact is allowed, although in professional settings it is kept moderated to a low level (similar to rugby).

A regulation Peliskpalo court is approx 80 metres long and 40 metres wide, with progression lines placed every 5 metres. At either end is a score zone, into which the ball must pass to score a point. The ball is a solid cork ball coated in rubber, set at a regulation size of roughly 6 inches in diameter (roughly 19 inches in circumference). This produces a relatively heavy ball when compared to air-filled examples from Earth.

Players wear only light protection, usually restricted to thin pads on sensitive areas.

### The Tiziran Currency
> "Working with the Tizirans makes me damned glad we went decimal."

To understand Tiziran currency, it is first important to understand lizard mathematics- owing to the lizard physiology of 4 fingers per hand, many number systems on Tizira throughout history were to a base 8, instead of humanity's 10. From this, a hexadecimal number system developed to base 16, and this is today used across the planet. Lizard currency, therefore, is also to a base 16. The Tiziran Rena, or Crown, is the only official legal currency on Tizira, although Universal Credits are also frequently accepted by larger companies and in major cities.

A complex systems of coins dominates the Rena, with coins representing fractions of a full Rena. The smallest increment is the sekata (half kata), which is 1/32th of a pelata or 1/512th of a rena. From there, the increments build up as such:
1 kata (pewter) = 2 sekata (1 k)
1 selkata (two kata) = 2 kata
1 talkata (four kata) = 4 kata
1 yalkata (eight kata) = 8 kata
1 pelata (iron) = 16 kata (1 p, 1/-)
1 korta (gold) = 32 kata = 2 pelata (2 p, 2/-)
1 alsan (sword) = 64 kata = 4 pelata (5 p, 5/-)
1 serena (half rena) = 128 kata = 8 pelata (10 p, 10/-)
1 rena (crown) = 256 kata = 16 pelata (1 r, 20 p, 20/-)

Currency below a few rena is frequently expressed as pelata/kata, as these are fairly convenient coins to carry. Rena notes exist to the base 16, in order of 8 rena, 16 rena, 32 rena, etc.

### Cityraisers: Masters of Civil Engineering
> "Blessed be the builder, for by his claws is civilisation made."
- Ancient Tiziran Saying

When discussing lizardkind's greatest feats, many scholars turn to Tiziran civil engineering. From centuries of early industrialisation and harsh conditions, the Tizirans have developed an extremely strong ability at construction and engineering. This can be seen while wandering the streets of almost any Tiziran city, with lavishly detailed buildings that make no compromises on beauty nor functionality; grand urban gardens and parks; impressive statuary that captures centuries of history in stone. Indeed, life in a Tiziran city is in many ways idyllic.

This collective experience started with the requirement to develop effective methods of water transport and distribution. Early Tiziran settlements were therefore characterised by strong centralisation and public works- qanats, canals, reservoirs and cisterns, and then the harnessing of the power of water via waterwheels to power the beginnings of industry. Much of these initial settlements have been lost to time and war as the centuries rolled by (although older regions still bear ruined aqueducts and other such telltale signs of history), but the experience in city planning that their use imparted can be seen even today.

As might be expected from a people that have mastered civil engineering, Tiziran cities are littered with great works. Examples include the Waterworks of Taraviero, which is Tizira's largest surviving (and indeed, functioning) series of civil waterworks spanning across much of the medieval city centre. Included are the Grand Stepwell, a massive water storage structure running down Taraviero's main thoroughfare, the Tiziran Gardens, a large water garden near the site of the city's old castle, and the colossal Aqueduct of Taraviero, running an impressive 27 miles from Lake Ara in the Adeni Mountains into the centre of Taraviero's old city. Also included are the network of cisterns and water fountains which kept the city's populace supplied throughout the centuries, although a number are today rendered nonfunctional due to damage to the pipe system- and none produce potable water due to lead contamination from the ancient pipes.

Taraviero also has another important landmark- the Soda Gardens and Baths. The local geology of Taraviero has lead to a number of natural soda springs nearby- producing carbonated water, these springs became the centre of a spa and wellness retreat in the early modern era, the Aldar Sanitarium and Health Baths. The institute constructed an extensive series of gardens using the soda water for water features, as well as "regenerative baths" which attracted nobility from across Tizira to bathe in the enriching waters. Later, the potential of Taravieran water was realised for drinking, and it began to be bottled and sold in the industrial age. Today, the spa complex, gardens and bottling are handled by the Taraviero Soda Company, although concern for the spring has lead to most of the bottled water and soft drinks made here being instead produced artificially from still water harvested in the region.

Zagoskeld has its fair share of impressive structures too, as is to be expected of the planet's capital. The Imperial Palace is a good place to begin: the current palace dates back to the early modern era, when the King of the newly unified Oskmarzel sought to move his court closer to the city. The site selected is on a small islet just outside Zagoskeld's city limits between the Tiga and Oron rivers, atop an ancient volcanic plug, and the location of a previous castle which was heavily damaged in a recent war and left to fall to ruin. This gives the royal palace an imposing view across much of the flatter land around it, as well as natural defenses against attack from the sea- although it was never designed to be a fortified castle. Its construction unfortunately outlasted the king, leaving his daughter as the first monarch to live in its walls. Throughout the years, the palace was expanded, and the road leading to it became a part of Zagoskeld city, specifically becoming the diplomatic quarter. Soon afterwards, the parliament building of Oskmarzel was built nearby at the northern tip of the islet. When Tizira unified under the Ozkmarzelic banner, the palace passed into being the seat of Imperial power, and the Oskmarzelic parliament building became the seat of the first Tiziran senate. Since then, the senate has moved to a new, purpose built building across the Oron river, with the old building being split into the official residence of the Prime Minister and a senatorial annex for commissions and small debates.

Another major landmark in Zagoskeld is the Triumphal Arch. Standing at 70 metres tall and dominating Zagoskeld's central thoroughfare, the Avenue of the Victorious March (or the Long March, for short), the Triumphal Arch is a monument to Oskmarzel's triumphs during the Wars of Unification. In the years since, it's become more of a symbol of Tiziran unity, with military triumphs to celebrate major victories ending their route at the Arch and its surrounding Plaza of Triumph.

Also of note is the New Fortress, standing at the opposing end of the Long March. Originally constructed shortly after the Imperial Palace, the New Fortress was designed to be a military hub and defensive structure for the growing city of Zagoskeld, in contrast to the old fortress on the site of the palace. Throughout the centuries, it received a number of expansions to keep up with the evolution of warfare, eventually becoming outdated in the industrial period. After a period of neglect, it was taken under the custody of the Archivist Order, who restored it and converted it into a tourist destination and museum. The urban headquarters of the Tiziran military was constructed adjacent to the fortress as a symbolic link to the Ozkmarzelic military's past. Today, the fortress is a popular tourist destination, and is famously utilised every Unification Day for the ceremonial firing of 149 guns- one for each member state which gave up their independence for the Tiziran union. This is also the traditional beginning to a military triumph- but Tizira has not celebrated one of those in over a century.

Additionally on the Long March is the Rizkalon Park, located at roughly the midpoint. A large and beautiful park, it is well known for three key features- the Water Gardens, an extensive example of Tiziran mastery of hydrology; the Necropolis and the westernmost entrance to the Halls of Atrakor's Own, Tizira's largest burial catacombs; and the Statue of the Unnamed Soldier, a monument to the unidentified dead of Tizira's many, many wars.
