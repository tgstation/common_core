# The Ashwalkers
> "The history of FTL travel is littered with teething problems- take the Tiziran example of the Thazakto, wherein the lizards' inexperience with bluespace wells lead to the loss of an entire colony ship alongside 600 souls..."
- "FTL Flight: 400 Years of Innovation", Dr M. Perajarven

Since Nanotrasen first arrived at the scorched hellscape that is Indecipheres, mining expeditions have mysteriously disappeared in the ashy wastes, never to be seen again. At the same time, a new threat emerged- known colloquially as Ashwalkers by the mining crew, these monsters seem similar to the lizards that humanity has known for decades, but rougher and more primal. This is not without reason- the Ashwalkers trace their lineage back to Tizira, but how they came to Indecipheres is another story.

Some 200 years ago, shortly before First Contact with humanity, the lizards created their first FTL-capable vessel- a colony ship, the ICS Thazakto, which would be sent off with the intent of finding a steady source of plasma, a material which was in extremely limited supply around Rizkalon. This material showed excellent promise as fuel for starships and (perhaps most importantly) as a way to breach the light-speed barrier and revolutionise transport. And so, lizardkind would pour some of their limited resources into an experimental vessel to take advantage of this miracle material, and importantly to locate a more permanent and substantial supply for future use. In a grand ceremony, the Thazakto pierced the light-speed barrier, and vanished into the great beyond. And then, there was nothing. Tizira never heard again from the pioneers aboard the ship.

On the other side of the artificial wormhole, chaos ensued. The trip had created an electromagnetic pulse, a risk of FTL travel unknown to the unexperienced lizards. Worse still, the Thazakto found itself caught in the gravity well of a nearby planet immediately on dropping from FTL speed, and the already weakened ship found itself unable to escape. The damage was severe, and of the crew of 600, only 120 emerged from the smouldering wreckage on what was to be their new home- a lava-drenched hellscape, where ash hung heavy in the air. Indecipheres.

The ship was reorganised into a makeshift shelter, and the survivors knew they would need to adapt to survive. Laws relaxed. Order crumbled. And then, the lizards made a dark discovery: the Necropolis, and its dark tendrils.

While they would resist at first, it was not long before a combination of hunger, the breakdown of society, and the incessant, ceaseless whispering of the Necropolis would take its toll and drive them insane. And with insanity came a new purpose: serving the voices within their heads. The Necropolis would reward this loyalty in the only way it knew how: to bring them into the fold more thoroughly. By the proxy of their fetish of worship, the Great Tendril, the Necropolis feeds from their sacrifices and creates new Ashwalkers in its twisted image from remains.

And so, the Ashwalkers stand, wearing their new titles as custodians proudly, hunting invaders with spear and claw, and protecting the Necropolis until their souls return to it.

### Important Facts
* The ashwalkers are essentially unknown beyond Indecipheres itself. While reports about them might trickle back through Nanotrasen's channels internally, the major governments of the galaxy know very little. Nanotrasen would prefer to keep it this way, too- if the Tizirans get wind of a settlement of what is *ostensibly* their people on a lucrative mining world, they may use it as a pretext to lay claim to the system, and bringing entirely too much federal attention with it.

### On Rehabilitation of Ashwalkers
> "It's a lot like being woken suddenly from a dream. Where once all I knew was the thrill of the hunt, now I am "normal", they say."
- Ka-Tal, first Ashwalker to survive rehabilitation

While the psychological and physiological alterations brought about by the Necropolis are numerous and severe, Ashwalkers are still Lizards at their core, and Nanotrasen scientists have, via extensive testing, found some success in rehabilitating ashwalkers taken from the surface of Indecipheres. Via removal of exposure from the Necropolis, alongside careful reintroduction to normal lizard living conditions and the social environment of the station, some ex-ashwalkers have had their Necropolis Adaptation reversed, and been nominally reintegrated with normal society where they serve as a novel source of labour for Nanotrasen's spinward stations. Many more, however, have died during attempts, or been driven mad in the process.

The reintegration process has been far from smooth. The rehabilitated ashlizards have no ties to the cultures of their lizard colleagues- indeed, their ways are alien to both the Tiziran-born-and-bred migrant workforce and the more humanlike Federal citizens. This has lead many to a crisis of identity- no longer ashlizard, they fail to fit in amongst other lizards either.
