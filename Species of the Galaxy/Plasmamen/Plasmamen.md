# A New Kind of Worker

While Plasmamen may, to the layman's eyes, look like merely purple skeletons, this does not tell the truth of the incredible complexity of the organisms that make them tick. For Plasmamen are not merely one organism, but millions, known as Colonids.

The Colonids are microscopic, plasma-based fungi, which form large networks with other Colonids. These colonies can eventually stretch to include billions of the organisms, with the collective forming a single cohesive social unit. Originally being discovered as a purple fungus around liquid plasma pools on the Icemoon, Freyja, Colonids were overlooked until Nanotrasen researchers discovered that they produced small electrical impulses. Further investigation revealed that these impulses were a simulacrum of nerve signals, and the researchers were curious enough to investigate whether these creatures may be a form of intelligent life.

It was these tests that would reveal the true potential of Colonids- during a routine inspection, Marcel Delacroix, a researcher assigned to the project, slipped and fell into a tank of liquid plasma which had been opened to test the Colonid content. Marcel died as a result of plasma exposure, and hasty preparations were made to recover his corpse from the tank. However, as his coworkers rushed to gather their gear, their attention was drawn to the tank by a series of banging noises. And they were then horrified to see Marcel, skin and muscle sloughed off to the skeleton, and covered in a fine purple membrane, stand up and begin staggering around. When dragging him out of the tank, he burst into flames, and was only extinguished when placed into an inert environment, at which point he began suffocating. Plasma was quickly flooded in- and so it was discovered that Colonids require a plasma rich environment, be that liquid or gaseous, to survive.

Tests were ran on the creature that used to be Marcel, and it was found that it possessed human-like intelligence- however, no trace of Marcel's personality remained. It was clear that this was a new being, which merely inhabited his corpse. Further testing showed that the plasmaman was quite capable of learning Common, manipulating its skeletal mouth and forming vocal cords to further improve its capabilities. Its anatomy was found to quite closely mirror that of humanity, but exclusing several organs which were clearly deemed as extraneous. To allow it to leave his containment cell, it was given an EVA suit flooded with a mixture of nitrogen and plasma, which prevented it from catching fire. And so, unwillingly, Marcel Delacroix became the first plasmaman as we know them today.

Following this discovery, Nanotrasen initially saw potential for these new beings in military applications- however, trials revealed that they were simply too frail to be of any use on the battlefield, and besides- they had free will, and a surprising number of the newfound species were more interested in cooking, or studying law, or any number of other pursuits, than in wanton murder. Frustration with the project ended up turning to excitement for corporate, however, when Nanotrasen realised that these new beings would be excellent for shoring up gaps in their workforce, as they required few of the amenities or even basic necessities that organic workers need to survive.

And so, the plasmaman became Nanotrasen's newest type of worker- reanimated corpses, ready to do mundane labour for little to no pay. However- plasmamen present a unique problem in the workforce- their propensity to catch fire. Hence, the creation of the Envirosuit was necessary to exploit this new workforce.
 
# The Suit 
 
The plasma envirosuit we know and love(?) today is an elegant blend of cost-effectiveness and ease of use (especially in the venue of neutralizing rowdy skeletons via helmet removal). 
 
Aside from this emergency use case, releasing burning plasma out (and burning oxygen in) at every little scratch is not ideal, thus the fabric of the envirosuit is made of two layers of heavily coated and tightly woven synthetic threads, with a layer of an extremely sticky and hard to wash glue-like substance sandwitched in the middle (the formula, though protected by corporate secret, is known to include tritium hydrocarbons less common than plasma). 

Thanks to this design, in case of a slash or rip in the fabric of the suit it can easily be mended through the simple application of pressure, and the built-in extinguisher charge does the rest. 
 
Said extinguisher charge is little more than a manually-toggled water dispenser located behind the vertebrae, which effectively reduces the plasma colonids' typical dryness (the leading hypothesis for the cause of such a low humidity is their tendency to rapidly absorb liquid water for hydrogen, an element which the organisms are always quite eager to consume). 

Plasmaman gloves are, contrary to popular belief, integral for the envirosuit to work. 
 
They're internally coated with thick memory foam to adapt to the sometimes lumpy boney fingers, and externally coated with thin but resilient rubber to maintain sensitivity and control in the hands. The hands on the envirosuit itself are one of the weakest spots on it due to these reasons. 
 
You might be thinking to yourself: this is all well and good, but, say, if a plasmaman has to, for example, put on glasses, are they screwed? The answer is, kind of! While the helmet is easy to quickly unscrew and equip again, such an operation can only be conducted safely under a shower, in an inert environment, or in the dangerous vacuum of space, unless the user is brave (or stupid) enough and quick with their reflexes.
 
# Reception
The crew of the stations to which plasmamen were tentatively introduced oddly didn't react all too poorly to the new colleagues. In the  words of Space Station 8's Captain Lucio Spurgis: "I've been through so much shit lately I barely noticed the purple guys coming out of arrivals." 
 
Space Station 5's Chief Engineer Ruth Blarbo instead remarks "They're cool I guess, they mostly spend their time tanning at the supermatter. It's a step up from the human staff who actively delaminate it just for kicks." 
 
Not everyone has reacted as positively, however. The Animal Rights Consortium and other ethics organizations have taken the news of a new species made of human corpses and alien goop being introduced to Nanotrasen stations, and especially the horror stories about envirosuit testing (how many had to burn before the product reached the market?) particularly badly, and have been steadily extending their Nanotrasen Book Of Grudges, motivating the rest of the Syndicate ever more for the next attack.

# Family Life
Plasmamen obviously don't _have_ families, as they emerge dripping and fully-formed from a lake of plasma as adults and cannot attribute any particular entity to be their relative apart from perhaps "the bacterial soup in general".
That said, emerging from the soup can be very confusing and disorienting and resultingly Nanotrasen have organised a programme of "mentorship" where newly emerged Plasmamen are paired up with older volunteers, who can more easily show them the ropes of this new world they have arrived in. This move has been largely quite successful at increasing the speed of integrating new workers into Nanotrasen's corporate structure and understanding the ins and outs of life in an envirosuit without too many unpleasant mishaps, but is also perhaps the beginning of a means of Plasmamen to pass on a unique culture from one generation to another. Younger Plasmamen _do_ tend to remain socially close with their mentors following their "graduation" from the programme, and those who had a positive experience are themselves more likely to volunteer to mentor other new Plasmamen in the future, in turn creating widening social circles of Plasmamen with close bonds to each other.

Several distinct "family trees" of mentors and mentees are beginning to emerge over time, occasionally covertly favouring each other over other un-"related" Plasmamen with what little power and influence they have. What long term effects on this burgeoning race this accidentally-introduced social structure might have in times to come remains to be seen.

# Fun Factoids:
* Since Colonids are native to the Icemoon, the liquid plasma pools on the moon are teeming with them. Falling into one of these pools may result in becoming the next Marcel Delacroix.
* Plasmamen can infest any skeleton, or really any organic surface- those seen on Nanotrasen stations are generally human skeletons, as Nanotrasen is able to source them cheaply from the bodies of convicts. Yes, this means plasmamen can infest things like dinosaur skeletons, and yes, this is badass.
* Plasmamen have very human mannerisms, due mostly to their integration with human society on the frontier. That said, they have developed their own distinct culture in their short time on the galactic stage.
* Plasmamen are not only immune to radiation, but utilise it very efficiently as an energy source. Even the small amounts given off as background radiation on the Icemoon are sufficient to sustain them.
