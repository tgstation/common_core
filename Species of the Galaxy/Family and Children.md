# Family and Children

Within Earth's animal kingdom there are about as many ways to have and raise children as there are individual species of animal. As it is on Earth, so it is amongst the stars and in the modern era humanity have been presented with something new; *thinking* animals with their own biology, morals, and approaches to family life with whom they can argue. Every species has their own approach to forming a family, and naturally each thinks they also know best.

## Humanity

Human family structures under both TerraGov and the SSC in 2563 are largely based around the contemporary North American concept of the "Nuclear Family". While the precise structure varies widely based on individual circumstances it's still largely typical for children to be raised by an average of two parents who directly contributed to the birth of the child, with an average of one and a half directly related siblings.  
  
Children (be they "naturally" born or produced by a tube) spend roughly eighteen years being raised by their parents until they reach a point of legal independence and leave the family home to form their own families, usually undergoing many years of public or private schooling in the meanwhile.  
Cloning technology and genetic modification allow people who would otherwise find it difficult to produce children access to the opportunity (provided that they can pay for the service) but raising direct clones of yourself is considered socially unusual and generally the domain of rich eccentrics, and the rapid aging technology used to produce adult duplicates of living or deceased humans is generally out of the reach of an average citizen (and since the Felinid incident, also out of the reach of almost everyone else).  

Larger (and smaller) family units are certainly not unheard of, both due to the fact that divorce and absentee parenthood certainly haven't vanished in the future and that commited relationships involving more than two people are more widely accepted than they were 5 centuries before, but these highly capitalised societies still encourage the atomising of larger or multigenerational family units which might have otherwise been more common in other cultures into smaller groups, each of which can be sold their own house and amenities.  

## Felinids
In almost all respects except cultural, Felinids *are* humans. Their designation as a "species" is a legal construct rather than a biological one, as their genetic modifications do not in truth move them far enough from their ancestors to be regarded as a separate animal.  
Felinids then grow largely speaking in identical ways to how humans do; giving birth to similar numbers of children after a similar length of pregnancy, meeting similar developmental milestones at similar times, aging at a similar rate, and dying at similar ages.  
  
As not even a single generation has passed since Felinids emerged onto the galactic stage and they largely live entirely in mixed enclaves with other Humans rather than having any territory of their own, they simply have not had time to diverge significantly from the wider Human culture to any significant degree, however there are a few important things to note.  

While Felinids are entirely reproductively compatible with the rest of humanity they are an oppressed minority within Human space and so tend to be insular and stick together. Mixed relationships are inevitably actually quite common, but are often viewed with suspicion or distate by *both* Humans and Felinids for different reasons.  

The children of mixed parents predominantly present Felinid genetics quite strongly but more rarely can result in children who have either the iconic ears or tail but not *both*, or every so often a child which is indistinguishable from a "baseline" Human but who still carries latent Felinid genetics.  
The idea that someone could *appear* to be totally human but produce "surprise" children with their grandparents' ears and a tail is often drawn upon in modern soap operas and entertainments as a source of cheap drama, despite the fact that actual cases of this have been few and far between.
