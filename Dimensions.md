# Dimensions

In the 2550's, Nanotrasen has found the existence of multiple dimensions, taking advantage of them to gain a seemingly unfair advantage over their corporate competitors. Here's a quick rundown on all the discovered dimensions.

## Bluespace

Bluespace is a vast, (mostly) empty blue void not unlike deep space. Gravity acts as normal in bluespace, but there is a distinct lack of gravity due to the lack of objects to be pulled into. The dimension was the first discovered as a new breakthrough from a teleportation miscalculation that would consistently send objects "nowhere". To this day teleportation remains an incredibly energy intensive task with a very limited range, and until the use of bluespace's properties to "teleport" original teleportation was considered to be a universal constant-ruined concept.

To this day the number one way of reaching the bluespace is through teleportation, as it is one of the only dimensions to have a clearly discovered and understood calculation for reaching the same place in bluespace that you would have in reality. Bluespace is primarily used as teleportation, whilst secondarily used as storage (bags of holding, bluespace prison), from its incredibly useful property: The difference in distance traveled in bluespace versus reality. Moving 10 feet in reality will get you 10 feet, but making the same movement in bluespace and then exiting will allow you to move incredible distances. This is why teleportation was quickly discarded for bluespace "teleportation" which ends up being the exploitation of bluespace's dimensional rules.

Trivia: Bluespace has a lot of floating trash around from miscalculations and other forgotten projects in the development of teleportation, but this is only even noticeable near central command and space station 13, where these tests took place.

## Reebe

Reebe is a white dimension followers of Ratvar said was created by Ratvar themselves. It was being used as a pocket dimension for the cultists to hide from Nanotrasen and fulfill whatever evil plot they had.

Knowledge about Reebe is incredibly limited given the only known way to reach it died along with the cultists, who would mysteriously travel freely to and from.

Trivia: If the creation story of Reebe is to be believed, then you could infer that Nar'Sie would also have one. Is the dimension demons come from Nar'Sie's dimension?

## Netherworld

The Netherworld is one of the few inhabited dimensions, with the inside being a vast plane of fully lit rainbow structures, flora, and sky. The dimension is survivable atmospheric and pressure wise, but is filled with esoteric creatures of all sizes and shapes and colors, ranging from the size of ants to large buildings. The natural fauna within seem to be interlocked in a constant hyper evolutionary race, making a documentation of species impossible.

The only entrance to the Netherworld has been natural "links" found in the Spinward Periphery. Unfortunately, these are two ways and as such occasionally a creature wanders into our reality. These creatures are nearly always dangerous and make reaching the link itself difficult. Even if you reached the link itself, being inside is both mind melting and incredibly lethal. As such, Nanotrasen has not made any advancements in taking advantage of the dimension.

Trivia: Oddly enough, undead sentience will feel an odd homely feel to the Netherworld link. Obviously, these undead arent coming from the link, so more research needs to happen on the mental effects observed in the link that could possibly explain the hyper evolutionary race.
