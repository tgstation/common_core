# NTHI (Nanotrasen Heavy Industry)
![NTHI logo](https://i.imgur.com/zMO6ZK5.png)
> ***BUILDING A BETTER TOMORROW***
Headquarters: NT European International Campus, Dortmund, Germany
Field: Resource Extraction and Heavy Industrial Equipment
Originally existing as the German Wulfe Gruppe, NTHI was the first major acquisition beyond computing made by Nanotrasen, starting their upwards climb to being one of humanity's foremost corporations. NTHI is the company's most profitable division, being responsible for around 1/3rd of Nanotrasen's overall net worth, as well as managing Nanotrasen's extensive plasma empire. Most of the stations and outposts found in the frontier and in major industrial centres are operated primarily by NTHI, usually with some involvement by NTFID.

NTHI's director is Heike Beissel. Elevated to the position due to her exemplary handling of operations at NTCS, Beissel is a company woman through-and-through; ruthless, profit-oriented, and willing to take almost any step necessary to ensure that NTHI is the foremost of Nanotrasen's divisions.

### NTCS (Nanotrasen Chemical Supply)
Field: Chemical Manufacture and Distribution
Another acquisition made in the early days of the company, NTCS began life as Texas Chemical, a major US-based chemical manufacturer. In the centuries since, it's grown to be one of humanity's largest chemical producers, although not large enough to secure its independence from NTHI. Today, NTCS is involved heavily in NTHI's plasma production, providing the various reagents required for the Altmeyer process. In addition, it produces a wide range of industrial and consumer chemicals, from battery acid through to petrochemicals.

### General Energy
Field: Energy, Petrochemical, and Fuel


# NTFID (Nanotrasen Futures and Innovation Division)
> ***EXPANDING OUR HORIZONS***
Headquarters: NT Southwestern Campus, San Jose, California
Nanotrasen's research and development division, responsible for pushing humanity's scientific boundaries and being on the cutting edge of innovation. Naturally, NTFID acts as a significant source of funding for Nanotrasen's endeavours as a whole in the form of grants from TerraGov, as well as being a magnet for talent due to partnerships with research groups at universities across human space. Additionally, NTFID is a signatory and member of the Terran Joint Research Collective alongside many other major corporations. In theory, this should ensure that discoveries made by NTFID's researchers make their way into the collective knowledge of mankind rapidly. In practice, the collective sees very little of Nanotrasen's juiciest research, instead getting scraps or anything that management has deemed "no longer critical to maintain secrecy on". NTFID is based out of the Southwestern Campus at San Jose, although it also has major secondary sites at Houston, Busan, Dortmund and Adasta City, and a huge number of lesser facilities across pretty much all of human space.

In terms of land share within Nanotrasen's full organisation, NTFID comes in second place behind NTHI, operating a large number of facilities across human space, including several major sites on the peripheries. One of NTFID's notable sites is Space Station 13, which it will operate jointly with NTHI until the construction of a more permanent mining outpost on or around Indecipheres is finished, at which point the station will pass entirely into its ownership.

NTFID's director is Mátyás Lórincz, who worked his way up through the ranks as a researcher and eventually into the upper echelons of management. Though driven and ambitious, Lórincz is also a true believer in the importance of science. This makes his role as the director of NTFID difficult, as he is often required to balance his genuine desire to drive scientific development and push the limits with his requirement to balance the budget and play the internal game of politics within Nanotrasen.

### New Horizons
Field: Surveying and Colonial Endeavours

# NTHW (Nanotrasen Health and Wellbeing)
> ***MAKING HEALTHIER LIVES***
Headquarters: Ishtar, Astarte, Alpha Centauri
NTHW is Nanotrasen's medical subdivision, tasked with medical research, health insurance, production of medical goods, and operation of hospitals, clinics, and deathcare facilities across human space. Despite consistent profits, the division has fallen on hard times in recent years due to the Prosperity cloning scandal damaging public trust, and this has resulted in a reduction of funding from corporate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this hasn't exactly made NTHW's higher-ups happy, and their approach to both external and internal politics has become increasingly ruthless, with Director Claire Duchamp being desperate to reclaim the division's lost glory by any means necessary.

# NTCG (Nanotrasen Consumer Goods)
> ***INNOVATIONS FOR A BETTER TOMORROW***

Headquarters: NT Asian Regional Headquarters, Busan, Korea
NTCG is responsible for most of Nanotrasen's publically-sold products; under their broad heading is included consumer electronics, automotive, aerospace, as well as dozens of smaller companies with their own branding under the NT umbrella. As might be expected of the division that produces everything from alarm clocks to spaceships, coffeemakers to industrial drills, or games consoles to handguns, they exercise a great deal of power within NT's internal politics game and generate a lot of revenue for the corporation.

NTCG is based out of Nanotrasen's Asian regional headquarters in Busan, Korea, in addition to operating extensive manufacturing across the human core territories, especially on the Moon, Adasta, San Garcia, and dozens of other planets. In the further reaches of human space, NTCG's presence is very limited: it's simply not economical to build factories on the frontiers versus manufacturing everything where the customers are. This is the key part that makes NTCG a smaller division than NTHI or NTFID- it's not that they don't make money, or that they don't have a lot of employees, it's that their geographic reach is limited by their profit motive.

## NTCG Subdivisions
### Trasen-Knox Scientific
Headquarters: NT Southwestern Campus, San Jose, California
Field: Scientific Computers and Analytical Equipment
A legacy division of Nanotrasen, Trasen-Knox Scientific maintains the company's previous name, as well as its original purpose: high-grade scientific computing and analytical equipment. Operating under NTCG, Trasen-Knox doesn't make very much these days, but their products remain popular with the academic market, and the name still maintains some historical significance as the one that started the whole thing off.

Trasen-Knox maintains its site at the Southwestern Campus, purchased by Michael and Dale as they expanded out of Dale's garage in Fresno into a real company. Even if most of the rest of the company's moved away, at least some of its history stays alive here.

### Galaxywise Shipyards
Headquarters: Anderston Yards, Adasta Orbital
Field: General Aerospace
Much of Nanotrasen's strength as a megacorporation comes from their ability to practice what is essentially autarky- the production of all required goods from raw material to finalised item, with little to no reliance on external companies or factors. To this end, Galaxywise is critical to Nanotrasen's practice of autarky- from their orbital shipyards above Adasta, Nanotrasen is able to produce a wide range of important vessels, from small single-man scouting vessels to large-scale freighters and everything inbetween. Unfortunately for Nanotrasen, however, their autarky chain is broken by limitations imposed by TerraGov stating that only licensed corporations are capable of producing heavily armed vessels (the Merchant Marine Act states that any vessel capable of bearing armaments in excess of Class 2, the highest legal civilian grade, may be produced by licensed companies only)- a license Galaxywise has been unable to secure due to politicking by corporate rivals at the senate.

### GEW (Global Engine Works)
Field: Vehicles
GEW is one of the world's oldest engine works, having originated in the mid-1800s as a producer of railway steam engines. Into the 1900s, they broadened to aircraft, and then onto motorcars in the wake of the Second World War. After financial troubles in the early 2000s, they were acquired by Nanotrasen to further diversify the company's portfolio. GEW today is known for their bipolar range of vehicles, catering to both the lowest end of the market with budget options, and the extreme upper end with high-class supercars and luxury touring cars- in addition to maintaining their work on high-end aircraft engines. Additionally, their design expertise has been coupled into some of Nanotrasen's other companies, such as providing interior design for small luxury space vessels for ATA or atmospheric engine designs for Galaxywise.

### ATA (Adasta Travaux Aérospatiaux/Adasta Aerospace Works)
Field: Luxury Aerospace
If Galaxywise is Nanotrasen's answer to the demand for reliable budget ships, ATA is their answer to the cries of billionaire corpos and top politicians: a shipyard based around the creation of bespoke, luxury vessels fit for royalty. Operating as part of the Galaxywise Shipyard Facility, ATA builds palatial vessels to the exacting demands of its clients, at extreme cost. No two ships built there come out alike. Of course, ships from ATA are commonly used by Nanotrasen's top executives.
