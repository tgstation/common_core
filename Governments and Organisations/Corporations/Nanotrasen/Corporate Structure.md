# Nanotrasen: Too Big to Fail

> "Indeed, eventually a corporation becomes so large that it takes on the trappings of a state in itself; complete with bickering and politicking between individual divisions competing for resources from the top. Nanotrasen is no exception; in fact, it may be the archetypical megacorporation: bloated, bureaucratic, and internally cutthroat."

# The Many Centcoms
To Nanotrasen's employees in the Spinward Sector, Centcom is exactly that- Central Command. But, it is only one of many large centralised stations directly owned and operated by Nanotrasen itself to oversee corporate operations across the galaxy. CC-SS (Central Command: Spinward Sector) administers over Nanotrasen's operations in the Spinward Sector, under the watchful eye of Regional Operations Executive Harper Wong and her green-clad crew.

Important functions of Central Command stations include:
- Coordinating stations owned and operated by Nanotrasen's various subdivisions, keeping them in lockstep with Corporate's orders (as best they can, anyway).
- Acting as a regional logistics hub, dispatching cargo shuttles to stations throughout the sector.
- Being a hub for evacuation, in the unlikely scenario that a station needs to be fully evacuated.
- Acting as a regional headquarters for the Asset Protection and Security Division, and a hub for the ERTs they dispatch.

The Regional Operations Executives report directly to the board of directors, giving them the authority to execute Corporate's will in their administered sectors. Beyond this, they're also offered a fair amount of leeway and autonomy, so long as they keep their sector profitable and don't wind up dragging NT into a war.

Various examples of Regional Central Commands include:
- CC-AS (Central Command: Australicus Sector, located in the Christchurch Outlying Territory), ROE Carter Wright
- CC-HS (Central Command: Home Sectors, in Alpha Centauri), ROE Ousmane Cisse

# Internal Divisions
The many divisions of Nanotrasen are, in many ways, essentially companies of their own. While every one of them nominally answers to the board and the mother company itself, in practice, they have large amounts of autonomy in how they conduct themselves, especially the larger divisions such as NTFID, NTHI, and NTCG. These larger divisions operate their own stations, conduct their own hiring and personnel management, and this has, in turn, resulted in internal conflict. Since each of them is ultimately beholden to the board, and in particular to their allocation of funding, each branch also finds itself needing to show itself to be the best- and in turn, that the rest aren't as worthy of cash. This, of course, leads to byzantine politics- much like unruly siblings fighting each other, the branches often devolve into petty infighting, or worse, actual violence like sabotage or subterfuge. Corporate is left with the unenviable task of trying to rule over this mess, and their solution is to essentially do nothing so long as it doesn't affect their bottom line (or in other words, if they're going to sabotage each other, at least they shouldn't cost *corporate* money when doing it).
