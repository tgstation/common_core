#Primary Evacuation Protocol

>Form  22-50-DD-13 for standard class stations

Abstract: This form outlines proper protocol for crew and command staff undergoing a station evacuation procedure. Failure to comply with protocol risks company assets, personal legal protections, and personal safety. This form was designed for all standard class isolated stations (henceforth referred to as “the station”) populated by 20 - 80 personnel. 
An evacuation scenario is defined as a scenario in which the crew must abandon the station due to extreme risk to company assets. Company assets include precious raw material, personnel, proprietary technology, research data, weaponry, and network security.


## Criteria for declaring an evacuation scenario

Evacuation scenarios are declared when the assets of the station are at significant risk, and evacuation presents the best opportunity to protect station assets. These evacuations are called at the discretion of the commander in chief of the station (henceforth referred to as the captain,) or if applicable, the stations onboard artificial intelligence systems. 
In the event of the captain of the station's casualty or abandonment, the duty of discretion falls to departmental heads of staff. Results of improper calls to evacuate may be met with termination, execution, and defamation/

## Risks of evacuation
Abandonment of the station leaves many important station assets especially vulnerable, all assets and crew left on the station are assumed lost. It may be a very long time before a salvage team is able to be fielded, assuming that the station has not been compromised by enemy agents, hostile lifeforms, or otherwise unsafe conditions. Failure to evacuate will result in your person being labeled “deceased” and all personal assets not accounted for being added to company general supply.

## General responsibilities during an evacuation
All crew members should board the escape shuttle at the first available opportunity, provided they have no other significant responsibility to fulfill. If you are unable for some reason unable to reach the escape shuttle, they may opt for an emergency escape pod. The likelihood of rescue by means of escape pod is far less likely due to costs associated with search and rescue.
If a crewmember opts for an escape pod, the cost or the rescue operation will be owed to the crewmember. Failure to pay or assume proper debt will result in forced collections which may include but is not limited to indentured servitude, scientific experimentation, and organ harvesting in order to recoup the cost of the rescue.

## Specific responsibilities during an evacuation
The following tasks should be accounted for prior to the departure of the escape shuttle.
- The nuclear authentication disk must be secured on the person of the Captain (or head of staff in the event of the Captain's absence.)

- All of the physical hard drives containing all collected research data must be brought to the escape shuttle, and uploaded to the shuttle’s internal data servers. The station side data servers must be wiped of all data. This is the responsibility of the station's research director.

- Identified enemies of the cooperation and other capital criminals held in indefinite detainment should be brought into the brig section of the shuttle for secure transport for interrogation and processing. This is the responsibility of the warden, and by extension all of the security team.

- Valuable assets, which include but are not limited to, plasma, bluespace crystals, weaponry, station cyborgs, and the station artificial intelligence system, should be transported onto the shuttle. This is the responsibility of the station’s quartermaster.

In the event that there is no one to fulfill these obligations, the duty may be assigned by the captain.

## In transit procedure.
Crew members should remain calm and orderly in transit. It is important that you ensure your station ID is securely fastened and presented, otherwise a central command officer may recognize you as a foreign agent and dispatch you upon arrival. In the event of active enemy 
agents acting on the escape shuttle, please see form 22-42-AN-04 for how to apply for heroic sacrifice compensation.
