## Moonrakers Trading Conglomerate
Headquarters: None

>"Having my latest find appraised turned out to be trickier than I had anticipated, so my contact suggested reaching out to the Moonrakers. Depending on who you ask they are either the last bastion of freedom or people that would do anything as long as there's money to be made. I don't think they themselves agree which is which. Either way, there's no denying they had the means and expertise."
-"The Unknown and Lesser Known of the Spinward sector", Vedika Bakshi

Back in the late 2100's the Moonrakers Movement was founded to pushback against Terragov's encroaching the off-world markets during the early days of space colonization. It's proponents would preach about the sanctity of the free market and personal freedom while the Terran Federation still struggled to crack down on the flood of contraband amid the foundation of the first space colonies.

Not everyone agrees the movement was as spontaneous as it looked on the surface, and although never proven, many powerful groups certanly were to benefit greatly from it.

This would all but become obvious when the Conglomerate officially became a corporation off the back of the Martian Revolution in 2280. Originally founded by several high profile trading magnates hoping to win the battle with the power of burocracy, it has since evolved into a massive distribution network of big and small companies.

Their public appearance still clings to their staunchly capitalist ethos of complete freedom from government involvement, although they will still begrudgingly abide by Terragov laws to operate in their territories, or at least by anything their army of lawyers think they can get comfortably get away with.

Word is that under the mask of a legitimate corporation the Moonrakers are a major supplier of black market goods and there's nothing they won't sell to those with the right connections - and for the right price, of course.


## Doubletime! Logistics
Headquarters: HKF Somere, Grand Nomad Fleet

>"It's not just fast, it's Doubletime!"
-Doubletime Company Slogan

It was only natural for the nomad fleet to rent out every inch of free cargo space while on their way to their next destination, but eventually what were once just occasional jobs done out of convenience became a full fledged operation of trading and long distance hauling.

The foundation of Doubletime Logistics as a proper corporation came as a surprise at the time as the fleet had remained persistently insular and reticent to deal with outside powers in any official capacity. It became a turning point that would slowly open the fleet more and more to both trading and diplomacy, on which they greatly rely nowadays.

Although they still fall under direct ownership of the admiralty, their position as something of a middleman between the admiralty and the outside world means supply deals tend to go through them first, and much of the fleet's required supplies are reliant on them as a result. Their influence allows them an atypical degree of freedom to operate as they see fit. This preferential treatment compared to the rank and file of the fleet has made them a somewhat controversial topic among their own and competition to join their ranks is fierce.

Their ability to reliably haul extremely large quantities of cargo is well documented, though whether their trade goods are always legitimately acquired is sometimes questionable. Nevertheless, they are a prime supplier of both new and refurbished ship parts, engineering tools and assorted oddities they may have picked up from every corner of the galaxy.
