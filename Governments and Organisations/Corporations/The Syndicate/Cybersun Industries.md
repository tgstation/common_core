## Cybersun Industries
Headquarters: TerraGov International District of Hong Kong and Macau, Earth

Insofar as any of the Syndicate's many factions can be called the "head" of the organisation, Cybersun Industries has a better claim to that title than most- as the primary source of funding for the Syndicate, as well as the largest corporation within its ranks by far, and one of its founding members, Cybersun has a commanding role within the Syndicate.

Founded originally in the wake of the Russo-Japanese War as the Ichikawa Group, Cybersun would find its footing as a zaibatsu, specialised in the production of automotive parts, mining, and aerospace engineering. With the collapse of the zaibatsu model following WW2, the Ichikawa Group would lose a number of its holdings, and edge close to bankruptcy, only being saved by the end of America's involvement in dissolving existing corporations- and their involvement with the Yakuza. In the coming century, Ichikawa would enter the electronics market, becoming a household name for the production first of computer parts, then of full systems, and eventually for high end computer appliances. At the same time, they would branch out into a number of areas, becoming a true conglomerate with dozens of companies under their belts. In the late 1980s, they would rebrand to Saibasan Sangyo, though the Ichikawa family would maintain ownership of the company. Eventually, as Terran Common became the language of business, this name would be anglicised to Cybersun Industries. The company would continue to grow through the centuries, eventually becoming one of the few true megacorporations. They would move their headquarters from their original location in Osaka to the TID of Hong Kong and Macau in the 2400s, in order to take advantage of the more business-like environment. This city is now essentially their playground: very few other corporations dare to maintain property here, knowing that the city is under the control of Cybersun in all but name.

As a company, Cybersun is primarily concerned with artificial intelligence and cybernetics, although they do have their foot in as many doors as possible, such as their controlling stake in plasma mining on Mars, gas skimming on Saturn, and sulfur mining on Venus. They were behind many of humanity's first advancements in AI technology, including the first functional AI, but as time went on Nanotrasen pulled ahead in this area and began to threaten Cybersun's strangehold monopoly. This prompted Cybersun's CEO to pull together a clandestine meeting with several other corporate bodies and factions which were being hurt by Nanotrasen's seemingly meteoric rise to prominence- the Gorlex Marauders, Waffle Corp, Interdyne Pharmaceutics, and MI13. The result of this meeting was the first incarnation of the organised Syndicate, a group dedicated to countering Nanotrasen's influence by any means necessary.

Many of the colonies on Mars and Venus were first settled by Cybersun during the initial gold rush of colonisation throughout Sol, including Mars' capital. This paid dividends for them once the plasma rush started.

Cybersun operates their own private military, which has been partially integrated with the Gorlex Marauders since the foundation of the Syndicate. They form a professional backbone for the undisciplined Marauders, increasing their effectiveness in operations against Nanotrasen. Cybersun also takes charge of most of the Syndicate's operations, acting as the brains behind the entire group. Cybersun operatives are ruthlessly efficient, taking cues from their Japanese heritage. Cybersun is known to frequently make use of assassins to bring their enemies to heel, in addition to corporate hitsquads and their own deathsquads: the Silencer Operatives.

Chances are if you see a cyborg, an implant, cybernetics, or advanced technology in the hands of a syndie, that it originated in the mind of a Cybersun researcher.

# Cybersun Industries
### Humanity's *Second* Largest Megacorporation
> "You can't be serious about trying to move into Hong Kong. That's Cybersun's city, you'll be dead within a week."

Insofar as any of the Syndicate's many factions can be called the "head" of the organisation, Cybersun Industries has a better claim to that title than most- as the primary source of funding for the Syndicate, as well as the largest corporation within its ranks by far, and one of its founding members, Cybersun has a commanding role within the Syndicate.

## Origins
During the 1800s, Japan underwent a significant period of modernisation and "westernisation", spearheaded by the Meiji emperorship. In this new world of economic and social evolution, the zaibatsu model emerged- similar in many ways to the western corporation, these private enterprises would exert significant influence over the direction Japan would take over the next century or so. One of these zaibatsus was the Ichikawa Group- opening initially as an engineworks in the city of Osaka, scientific advancement would cause them to shift into the automotive industry. Mining and aerospace would soon follow, with the company receiving extensive funding from the Japanese government to provide equipment for Japan's increasing militarisation. And then, WW2 happened.

To describe the effects of the war as anything but devastating for Japan would be putting it mildly. In the turmoil, many of the Ichikawa Group's assets were nationalised. In the wake of the war, the occupation by the Americans targeted the zaibatsus for dissolution, and this order included Ichikawa. However, the order was not seen through to completion, as America did not want a weakened Japan to fall to communist influence. And so, the Ichikawa Group was saved. Indeed, they emerged from this period of strife stronger than ever- as they found new allies in criminal elements in Japan.

Throughout the 20th century, Ichikawa would become a household name in a new, exciting field of industry- electronics and computing. The resulting flow of cash allowed the group to expand, taking on a number of smaller entities across a wide range of industrial sectors. During the 1980s, a push for a new brand identity lead the company to officially rename itself to Saibasan Sangyo, often anglicised to Cybersun Industries. Cybersun would continue to experience incredible economic growth, propelling it to become one of Earth's "big three" corporations, alongside the American Nanotrasen and the European Waffle Corp.

During the 2400s, seeking greater economic freedom, the company would move its headquarters to the TID (TerraGov International District) of Hong Kong and Macau, and would promptly set about turning the city into their own personal playground. Today, very few corporations operate within Hong Kong besides Cybersun, knowing that the city is their de facto territory. Indeed, as is much of East Asia- Cybersun stands alone as East Asia's singular megacorporation, with regional headquarters in nearly every major city across Japan, China and Korea, and extensive holdings across Indochina and Maritime South-East Asia.

## Enterprise
As might be expected from humanity's second largest corporation, Cybersun has stakes in almost every sector under the sun, via a mind-boggling number of subsidiaries. However, few will know Cybersun as the one making their car, or the medication they take, or the video games they sit down to play. Indeed, if you asked the average Terran citizen what Cybersun does, you'd get two responses- makes robots, and mines plasma. These are Cybersun's key sectors- the ones that make them the most money overall, and the ones that they are best known for.

On the robotics side, Cybersun is humanity's biggest producer of virtual and artificial intelligence systems. This includes everything from digital assistants and medical VI units to warship predictive targeting systems and full-scale station control AIs, and everything inbetween. Cybersun-made systems enrich the lives of almost every human across the galaxy everyday, whether they know it or not. And it is for this reason that Cybersun is particularly annoyed with Nanotrasen making inroads into AI tech, and indeed showing promise of surpassing them- it threatens Cybersun's near monopoly, and could result in the loss of a *lot* of business.

From a mining perspective, Cybersun made significant strides in creating a strong material business with their cornering of the Martian plasma market and Venusian sulfur market. These are only its biggest successes- they also hold significant stake in humanity's supply of a number of important metals and minerals across the entirety of human space- but, in recent years, this has been threatened by Nanotrasen's expansion of NTHI, and particularly by the discovery of Indecipheres' incredible mineral wealth. This was the final straw to break the back of the tenuous corporate peace between humanity's megacorporations, and lead the Cybersun CEO, Goro Ichikawa, to put into practice a plan that Cybersun had been brewing for years- the formation of a bloc to oppose Nanotrasen by any means necessary, otherwise known as the Syndicate, for which membership would be "extended" (willingly or not) to a number of important organisations and corporations across human space and beyond.

## Subsidiaries
The largest and most prosperous of Cybersun's subsidiary branches is Ichikawa-Exagon, formed from the merger of Ichikawa Mining and Exagon Extractions. This company handles Cybersun's vast mineral extraction empire, including their plasma mines. Under the I-E brand, Cybersun has cornered the Martian plasma market, the Venusian sulfur market, and beyond.

Next in size is the Ichikawa Banking Group- headquartered in Taipei and with branches the galaxy over, it comprises a number of smaller banks and investment firms under the Ichikawa umbrella. This generates a considerable cashflow for the rest of the company, as well as giving Cybersun a critical ability to influence and subsume other corporations via financial means.

Edo-Ka Medical Devices is another Cybersun subsidiary, being a general brand under which the company distributes a number of medical devices, from hospital equipment such as MRIs or chemsleepers, to medical cyberware in cooperation with Cybersun Robotics.

Cybersun Securities and Military Development is a twin-headed beast, being comprised of Cybersun's military manufacturing sector on one side, and Cybersun's private military company holdings on the other.

Additionally, Cybersun has a massive number of smaller subsidiaries.

## The Modern Company
Cybersun Industries remains under the control of the Ichikawa family, with the latest head of the family, Goro Ichikawa, having taken over the business in 2494. Goro's old age has prompted the company to begin planning for succession, even though the patriarch's mind is as sharp as ever and his health is generally good. Next in line to the illustrious corporate throne is his daughter, Kotone, the Golden Child, who acts as the CEO of Cybersun's robotics division- typically the reserved position of the favoured child. Other major contenders include Goro's other children, each of whom has been granted control of a Cybersun subsidiary- Katsumi, CEO of Ichikawa-Exagon; Hinata, CEO of the Ichikawa Banking Group; Osamu, CEO of Edo-Ka Medical Devices; and Fuyuko, CEO of Cybersun Securities and Military Development. The Shogun's disfavour does not extinguish his wayward childrens' ambitions- indeed, rough battle lines are drawn across the company, though none would dare to actually make moves against each other until Goro finally leaves the world behind.
