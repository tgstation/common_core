# Gorlex Marauders
### Death in a Red Hardshell
> "We need manpower, and unquestioning manpower at that. Bring the Gorlex on comms. I have a proposal for them."

While Cybersun is the brains and the money behind the Syndicate, the Gorlex Marauders are its sword- kept on permanent retainer by Cybersun for mind-boggling amounts of money, the Marauders form a loyal and unquestioning, if undisciplined, army for the Syndicate to field against Nanotrasen in the Spinward Corporate War.

## Origins

In the wake of the Third Soviet Collapse, the Spinward Sector found itself in a period of functional anarchy as the fledgling SSC struggled to reassert control from New Moscow. During this time, honest livings became hard to come by, and as such, the populace turned to less-legitimate methods of making money. One such group borne of this attitude were the Gorlex Marauders, who raised the black flag and took to piracy to make ends meet, siphoning wealth and supplies away from the wealthy Kalon run that came through the region.

Of course, such situations rarely last, and as the Spinward Sector once again settled down under the control of the now-stronger SSC, the Gorlex Marauders found themselves rapidly being pushed out of their line of work. And so, a great divide formed in the Gorlex ranks, between those who favoured settling down and going "legit" as a private military, and those who wanted to continue the pirate lifestyle. Eventually, this led to a split as the pirates went independent (many later merging into the Solars), and the modern-day Gorlex Marauders (or Gorlex Securities LLC, as their official listing calls them) was born.

Throughout the years, the Marauders would earn their stripes as a brutally effective military force. With little in the way of regulations to stop them, they became perfect goons for corporate conflict on the frontier, being willing and able to unleash tactics that would make even a Blackstar operative think twice. As time went on, and their reputation grew, their signature style would become a legendary sight- their blood-red hardsuits, surplus military weaponry, and plasteel ship armour, all sights that make enemy corpos piss their pants in fear.

As the main front-men of the Syndicate in the Spinward Sector, much of the Marauders' iconography has become synonymous with the organisation itself. The hardsuits, the plasteel- even the unofficial logo of the Syndicate, the triple-headed snake, is drawn directly from the Marauders' own logo. Cybersun might be the Syndicate's brain (and wallet), but the Marauders are its sword.
