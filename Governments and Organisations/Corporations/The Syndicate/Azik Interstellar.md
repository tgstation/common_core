# Azik Interstellar
### In the Absence of Plasma
> "An inroad to the Tiziran market? You have my attention."
- Goro Ichikawa

One of the Tiziran Empire's most renowned shipbuilding concerns, Azik grew powerful and wealthy making luxury vessels for the millionaires of Tizira. Combining speed and elegance, their vessels have become the first choice for diplomats, high ranking politicians, wealthy celebrities, and even the royal family themselves. And yet, despite all this prestige, Azik finds themselves in a precarious situation following human contact. Much like all of Tizira's shipbuilders, they are faced with an inability to compete with humanity's equivalents, due in no small part to the lack of access to plasma. With some maneuvering of Tiziran import laws, they are able to source parts to construct ships at a competitive standard from outwith Imperial borders- but not in a way that is profitable in the long term.

Azik's agenda within the Syndicate is simple- they seek to gain close ties to Cybersun, and to support their efforts in the Spinward Sector to obtain a readily-available supply of cheap plasma. In doing so, they hope to make themselves the primary shipbuilders in the Tiziran Empire, breaking into the lucrative world of military contracting.
