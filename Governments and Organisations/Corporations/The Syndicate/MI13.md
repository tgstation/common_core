### Information from the Shadows
> "This information, this "MI13". I cannot help but think that it is all too good to be true. Such accurate intel never comes for free."
> "And yet, we can't afford to turn it down, father. Your fears are well founded, but without that intel, we fight Nanotrasen blind and deaf."
