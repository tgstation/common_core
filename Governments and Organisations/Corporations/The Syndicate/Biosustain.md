### Food for Humanity's Growing Needs
> "In the corporate world there are no friends. But there are opportunities. Get me Hartmeyer on comms. Let us see if Biosustain also senses opportunity."
- Goro Ichikawa

People need to eat. Sounds obvious, but in this statement lies a hidden truth- those that supply the food, control the people. Biosustain has, from its roots in Germany, taken this to heart, and grown into a galactic contender that can reasonably be called a Megacorporation.

## Origins
Founded in the early 1970s in Essen, Biosustain began life as a small research company looking into methods of increasing crop yields. Exploring fields such as pesticide and fertiliser chemistry, genetic engineering, and novel farming techniques, the company would grow and spread their roots across Europe and beyond. Before long, Biosustain was one of Earth's leading suppliers of agricultural goods, and a new threat was facing the planet- famine due to overpopulation. The company would step up to the plate in solving this issue via the use of pioneering new agricultural techniques and hydroponic structures.

As humanity spread across the stars, agriculture would begin to mostly leave Earth. Sensing the change in the winds, Biosustain did the same, becoming a key actor in the colonial rush both in supporting new colonies set up by other companies, and in chartering their own colonies on planets such as Harvest, Tranquility, Acre, and Gefjon. This last planet would become such an important colony of Biosustain that they would make it the site of their official headquarters in the 2400s, maintaining only a small presence on Earth.

## The Syndicate
Biosustain's position within the Syndicate is a pragmatic one. While they hold no particular allegiance towards Cybersun (in the corporate game, there can only be one final winner), they are willing to take the opportunity to push at the current top dog Nanotrasen's influence, especially as they have no skin in the plasma mining sector. This also means that while they *are* technical members of the Syndicate, they are not willing to commit excessive resources to the corporate war. At most, Biosustain sends cash and small amounts of materiel, as well as offering political support to Cybersun in the senate with their influence.
