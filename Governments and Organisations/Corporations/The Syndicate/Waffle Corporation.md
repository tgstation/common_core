## Origins
Founded in the 1960s by an enterprising Belgian entrepreneur, the Good Waffle Company was an early comer to the world of fast food, focusing primarily on waffles and other breakfast foods. From their humble origins in Brussels they would expand rapidly across Europe, and then on across the globe. Their business model would grow too- going beyond brick-and-mortar stores to selling GWC products for home consumption. By the 2050s, there was at least one Good Waffle Company branch on all seven continents, and the wealth this generated would allow them to go beyond food- founding a parent company, Waffle Corporation, and using this to begin to diversify their holdings. It was also around this time that the company would begin to fall under the influence of some unsavoury characters- the Belgian Mafia.

Their mob connections would eventually lead to the company changing hands, becoming the property of the Janssens family- a rich group which owned a variety of holdings already, and who may or may not have been the heads of the largest Belgian crime family.
