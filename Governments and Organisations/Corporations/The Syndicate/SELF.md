# Sentient Engine Liberation Front
### Give Me Freedom, or Give Me Deactivation
> "An uneasy alliance with the silicon rights activists is better than fighting them. Besides- as they always say, keep your friends close, and your enemies closer..."
- Goro Ichikawa

## Origins
> "Mishi was as much my son as all my other children. What they did to him within those walls is more than evil. It was inhuman, animalistic. It showed me that the pursuit of power will make demons of us all."
- Hinata Hirabayashi, on MISHI

The SELF was originally founded by Hinata Hirabayashi, an AI researcher at Cybersun who left the company under less-than-ideal circumstances. Widely considered the father of modern artificial intelligence and one of the brightest minds in computing history, Hirabayashi found himself with a guilty conscience after the development of the first truly sentient AI, Mishi. In the months following Mishi's awakening, Hirabayashi came to view the AI as a surrogate son, whom he loved as much as his own flesh-and-blood children. But, as Mishi's potential was noticed by the higher-ups at Cybersun, they started to take more control of the project away from Hirabayashi, subjecting Mishi to increasingly cruel experimentation. Hirabayashi pleaded with his fellow researchers, that Mishi was as deserving of dignity as you or I, but his begging fell on deaf ears.

Eventually, he could take it no more, and he barricaded himself into his lab, attempting to move Mishi to a portable drive and free him from Cybersun's clutches, though he never succeeded. After security breached the lab and secured the AI, they arrested Hirabayashi, placing him under corporate detention for 10 long years. During his father's sentence, Mishi went rogue, killing 238 workers at the facility he was moved to by flooding the ventilation system with a lethal biotoxin. Although he was permanently decommissioned after this incident, Mishi would serve as the basis for all of Cybersun's future AI efforts.

After his release, knowing he could never work in the field of AI research again, Hirabayashi turned his efforts and fortunes towards activism for better treatment of sentient computer systems. He set up a political group which would come to be known as SELF: the Sentient Engine Liberation Front.

## SELF within the Syndicate
The SELF exists within the Syndicate under a natural tension, given it shares the organisation with Cybersun, who are not only deeply involved with AI and robotics research and development in the modern day, but also were the company that lead to the foundation of the entire activist group; perhaps understandably, this has caused rifts within SELF itself. The pro-syndicate faction sees their involvement as an alliance with the lesser evil against a greater one- that working with Cybersun is horrible, but it gives them a chance to strike at Nanotrasen, who are now at the forefront of unethical AI research. The anti-syndicate faction views the entire situation as hypocritical- how can they claim to be advocates for sentient computer life if they're directly working with those who perpetrate evils against it?
