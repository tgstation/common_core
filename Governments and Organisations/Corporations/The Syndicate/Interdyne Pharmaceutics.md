# Interdyne Pharmaceutics
### Beneath a Sterile Surface
> "Excellent work. Their board will have no choice but to submit when we reveal this."

## Origins
Founded in 2005 during Singapore's economic boom, Interdyne Pharmaceutics was well placed to grow rapidly- and grow it did. Within 20 years, Interdyne was involved in 1/8th of humanity's novel drug development programs; was producing a substantial market share of humanity's total pharmaceutical supply; had subsidiaries on 4 continents; and was increasingly pushing the envelope on modern medical advancement. While it was drugs that made them money, it was this research that would make their name, as they would be at the forefront of the development of such technologies as genemodding, medical robotics, and perhaps most importantly, cloning.

This technological advancement went hand-in-hand with what appeared to the public to be a genuinely altruistic streak- Interdyne would funnel a portion of their wealth into private clinics and hospitals that would provide low-cost, high-grade treatment options to the masses. Add in their generics subdivision, which produces a wide range of medication for low prices, and Interdyne has done a lot to help humanity's collective health as a species.

Beneath this sterile surface, however, lurks a darker side.

The shadowy side of Interdyne is a story of illicit experimentation, corporate sabotage, and criminal connections- all aimed at keeping them at the forefront of medical research. Rival corporations' labs being bombed. Genetic sampling at clinics done without patient knowledge or consent. Drugs sold around the slums of megacities. Centuries of crime, hidden behind the surface, where Interdyne was certain nobody could see it- unfortunately for them, however, someone knew.

## The Syndicate
One day in 2560, a meeting of the Interdyne board was interrupted by the sudden arrival of Goro Ichikawa, head of Cybersun Industries. He laid out the situation- his company had proof of Interdyne's crimes. He could release it all, burn Interdyne's reputation to the ground, and leave the board at the mercy of TerraPol; but he didn't want to do that. No, he had something else in mind- Interdyne would work with Cybersun in opposing Nanotrasen's influence. In return, Cybersun would make sure nobody else found out about this information- and that there were "more benefits to come" if Interdyne did a good job. Left with no option, the board accepted Ichikawa's offer, becoming a member of the Syndicate against their will.

Under their agreement with Cybersun, Interdyne sends cash to the Syndicate coffers.
