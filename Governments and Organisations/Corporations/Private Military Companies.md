# The Private Militaries of the Galaxy

In a world dominated by corporate conflict, poor government oversight, and danger from which protection is necessary, it is no surprise that private militaries have become a commonplace and important part of corporate life.

The intertwining of private militaries and corporations would cement itself during the Chinese Revolution of 2234, which is also seen as the first truly major blow dealt to government power by humanity's corporations.

The Chinese Government, in the early 2200s, would seek to reduce the influence of foreign corporations within the borders of China, with the aim of halting their growing influence within the nation's institutions and root out the rot of corruption that had set in. This created a major conflict with these external corporations, who would seek to regain this power first by political maneuvering, and then by open conflict. For this purpose, a coalition of private militaries would be brought together by a group of corporations (similar to the Syndicate). Major organisations in this first Syndicate would be Cybersun Industries, Waffle Corp... and Nanotrasen.

The Chinese Revolution would end on the 14th of December, 2238, with the collapse of the 289 year old People's Republic. In its place, a divided China would stand, a puppet to the corporations that toppled its predecessor- and no romance of the three kingdoms would save it this time. To this day, China is a state artificially kept from becoming whole: corporate power rules in the nation- and private militaries continue to hold their relevance in maintaining this status quo, and in corporate conflict as a whole, in a new golden age for mercenaries.

## Blackstar Company
Headquarters: TerraGov International District of Hong Kong and Macau, Earth

When thinking of Private Militaries based on Earth, Blackstar Company is the first that most TerraGov citizens would think of, and for good reason: their shady dealings and abuses of human rights are legendary. Having been founded in 2146 as a security agency for early space colonisation efforts, Blackstar would soon branch out into other areas of operation, becoming involved in true mercenary work shortly afterwards. After cutting their teeth in such conflicts as the Central African Civil War, the Dubai Crisis, and the Red Thai Conflict, Blackwater earned their reputation for efficiency on the battlefield- and also for ruthlessness. Their poor treatment of civilians was kept under tight wraps, but obviously in the age of information it's impossible to hide things forever.

When the truth came forward, however, what happened was not what Blackstar expected. While the reaction from the world's government and population was exactly as horrified as expected, it attracted a new kind of clientele: corporations. The no-questions, no-nonsense approach of the PMC alongside their willingness to do what was necessary to complete their contracts was perfect for corporate clients, who were always looking for operatives to steal from, raid, or kill their opponents. The paychecks turned up on time, and they were always stacked with cash- no more serving half bankrupt nations who would try to nickel and dime them for every bullet fired.

Blackstar would form one of the primary companies involved in the Chinese Revolution, with their area of operation being mostly in the urbanised south. After the war, they would move their headquarters to Macau. In the modern day, they are now essentially kept on retainer by Cybersun, who utilise them for operations where they cannot afford to send their own agents.

## Springbok Security LLC
Headquarters: Cape Town, South Africa, Earth

Somewhat oddly for a PMC, war is not the business of Springbok: they concern themselves more with private security, offering personal protection, site security, and armed and armoured convoys through hostile areas. Founded in the early 1970s in South Africa, Springbok would make a name for themselves as effective security for the dangerous streets of the nation, with contracts flooding in from high profile individuals, politicians, business owners, and even the South African Government itself. The sight of a Springbok operative with their signature blue shirts, green vests and Vektor assault rifles was common around the major cities of South Africa, and their armoured bakkies with their recognisable leaping springbok logo frequently made trips on the streets.

In the modern day, Springbok maintains its clean image, mostly acting as an independent security contractor for various corporations, as well as doing some ad-hoc work for TerraGov.
