# The Organisation of the TerraGov Armed Forces
The TerraGov military is administered by the TerraGov Joint Military Command- an international organisation formed of the member states of TerraGov for the expressed purpose of coordinating humanity's militaries. The TGJMC is then subdivided into a number of branches and subbranches, ranked in order of size:

1. TerraGov Navy
1. 1. TerraGov Naval Operations Division
1. 2. TerraGov Marine Corps
1. 3. TerraGov Starfighter Corps
1. 4. TerraGov Espatiers Corps
2. TerraGov Army
3. TerraGov Scientific and Exploratory Corps
4. Gendarmes Corps
5. TerraGov Rescue Corps
6. TerraGov Peace Corps

## TerraGov Navy
Ask your average citizen what they picture when they think of the military, and the Terran Navy is probably what they're going to say. With the transition to space came a major boost to the importance of the Navy; they're critical to exerting power beyond the confines of Earth, and without ships, the rest of the branches cease to function: ergo, they're the largest and most important of the branches, with the bulk of the Terran Armed Forces coming under its command.

The Army has lost most of its ground to the dominance of the navy, but still serves an important role in ceremonial duties and security, especially in a responsive role- as army units have no ties to a specific ship, they can be rapidly deployed to any front that requires them, and army soldiers still make up the majority of troops in defensive garrisons or undertaking military policing duties. Additionally, most army personnel assigned to ceremonial duties such as guarding monuments derive from the army.

The Scientific and Exploratory Corps handles government-mandated scientific expeditions and exploration. This group is only technically part of the military, and functions as a civilian organisation in most ways. The only time they truly earn their stripes is during an active war, at which point they may be called to assist with scouting or technological support.

The Gendarmes Corps is the Terran Federation's national guard, composed of reservists and militarised police under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. This division takes responsibility for security and policing of frontier, federal and high security territories: for example, the police force in the Manhattan Capital Region derives from the Gendarmes Corps, as would the police forces on small frontier worlds that are too small to have their own local recruitment, and the guards at the various spaceports across the core. Additionally, the Terran Federal Security Service forms an elite portion of the Gendarmes Corps that undertake anti-terrorist duties.

The Rescue Corps carries on the long traditions set out by the Coastguards of days gone by- maintaining security in space and rescuing people when things go wrong. If you get lost somewhere in deep space, these are the guys who'll be dragging you out of the fire to safety. While their numbers are few, they're very important to maintaining safety in TerraGov's territory.

Finally, the Peace Corps is a uniformed agency dedicated to providing medicinal advice, responding to disasters and emergencies, and generally maintaining the health and safety of TerraGov's citizens. This often sees them coordinating civilian bodies such as the Caduceus Organisation and corporate bodies such as DeForest or Interdyne to effectively distribute aid and organise responses to crises, and also makes them a very important body despite their relatively small size.

### The Citadel
The TGJMC is headquartered at the Citadel- a colossal campus on Long Island for strategising, coordinating, and generally managing an army that needs to maintain territory that spans hundreds of star systems. Understandably, security at this site is exceedingly strong, and most areas are closed off completely to the public.
