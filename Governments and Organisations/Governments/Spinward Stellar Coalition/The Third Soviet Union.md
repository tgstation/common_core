# The Third Soviet Union/Red Tommorrow Society
> "Fret not, comrades, for we shall rise like a great red phoenix once again."

Location: No official capital, small holdings throughout SSC space

Type of Org: Rump State/Insurgency

Though the fires of Spinward Communism burn dim, burn they do still. Despite being on the losing side of the February Revolution, the Third Soviet Union lives on in the hearts and minds of its diehard supporters across the Spinward Sector, where they maintain an insurgency against the Coalition that displaced them.

The February Revolution saw the end of Soviet power in the Spinward Sector and the rise of the nascent SSC. With the major planets of the Coalition declaring independence and splitting off to form their own republics, the central authority on New Moscow collapsed, and the planet fell with very little fighting. The remaining Soviet loyalists, mostly military personnel and politicians, vanished into the hinterlands of the Sector, licking their wounds and seeking to plan a return to power. Now, from hidden strongholds and in secretive cells, they continue the fight against capitalistic excess via guerilla warfare and terrorism against any and all who would seek to bring it; while the SSC may be their main target, they don't spare the corporations or TerraGov, either. With each passing year, they lose strength as members die off or lose hope; and yet, they are still a significant fighting force capable of causing major disruption throughout the entire sector.

Within the ranks of the insurgents, the term "Third Soviet Union" is frequently used, as they seek to maintain the political legitimacy of the previous state. Amongst the SSC, the name "Red Tomorrow Society", taken from the group that founded the Union, is more frequently used.

Notes:
* The hostile space Russians you see are mostly associated with the TSU, though some are just kosmogopniks with no cause and copious amounts of vodka.
* While they are hidden and their numbers are few, Soviet Remnants are a formidable problem for the SSC to deal with. Terrorist attacks by the group are a constant threat to major cities in the SSC, particularly in New Moscow.
* KS13 was a Soviet installation prior to being shut down during the collapse. The station was never reactivated by the SSC as it was deemed "too old" to bother expending resources on.
* There are rumours that the Soviets still possess the PWS Khranitel Revolyutsii, their old flagship that went missing during the collapse. If these rumours are true, the Soviets may be able to pose a serious naval threat in the region- but as no signs of the vessel have been found even across 50 years, many believe it's simply an apocryphal tale, a boogeyman for the politicians in New Moscow.
