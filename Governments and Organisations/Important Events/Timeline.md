2505: The February Revolution ends the Third Soviet Union. From its ashes rises the Spinward Stellar Coalition.

2507: War breaks out again between humanity and lizardkind as tensions boil over. Unlike the previous wars, this does not remain contained to minor scuffles over border regions, and both sides make major incursions into each others territory as the conflict edges close to total war.

2509: With stability finally tentatively returning to the Spinward Sector, the Gorlex Marauders split between those seeking to remain pirates and those looking to settle down and found a private military.

2515: The last (for now) human-lizard war ends in a crushing human victory as war arrives in the Tiziran home system of Rizkalon. Under the Treaty of Atrakor, rights to the entirety of the Spinward Sector are conceded to TerraGov, a DMZ is set up between the two powers, and an uneasy peace settles in. Both sides have fought hard and paid a high price, but nothing quite so much as the metaphorical slaying of a Tiziran God- as the moon of Atrakor was bombarded heavily by the Terran Navy and left with a permanent scar visible from Tizira's surface.

2515: Donk Corporation is founded in New Moscow by a group of ex-convicts seeking to turn their life around.

2558: Following an attempted attack on Nanotrasen's outpost over Indecipheres and the devastating destruction of a Ratvarian avatar via the newly-invented BSA, the Clockwork Cult recedes from public view to lick their wounds and regain their strength.

2560: The Prosperity Incident rocks Nanotrasen's genemed division, leading them to shutter their cloning clinics and severely scale back the use of the technology internally. Interdyne Pharmaceutics, who definitely had *nothing* to do with this, assumes a functional monopoly in the field.

2563: You are here!
