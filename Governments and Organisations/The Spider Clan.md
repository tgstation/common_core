# The Spider Clan
> "One: serve the Clan. Two: defend the Clan. Three: die for the Clan. Learn these words. Live by them. Die by them. You are one of us, now."

Originally founded sometime in the mists of prefeudal Japan, the Kumo Clan (Spider Clan) would rise to legend during the Sengoku Jidai, being (supposedly) responsible for a string of high-profile assassinations around the period. Following Japanese unification, the clan would retreat from the limelight again, until conflict arrived in Japan once again with the Meiji restoration. This time, however, the clan would make the wrong enemies during a botched assassination attempt on the Emperor himself. The resulting hunt for the ninja sent them reeling from their stronghold and underground, where they would make a new name for themselves in the criminal underworld.

And so was the way of it for centuries, until in the 2200s they made the same mistake again- making powerful enemies at the very top of the Japanese Government. This time, the fallout was even more severe, and the entire clan was forced into hiding- eventually finding their way to Mars, to the city of Sho-Kouba, where they would pick up the pieces of their broken clan and build it anew, at their secret headquarters known as the Spider's Nest.
