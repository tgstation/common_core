## Terran Unitary Dollar (Uni, U¢)
The Terran Unitary Dollar, or Uni for short, is the official currency of the Terran Federation, accepted in one form or another across the entirety of human space.

## Nanotrasen Credit (₦)
On Nanotrasen's various stations, to facilitate easy currency use within the company, the Nanotrasen credit was adopted. This currency functions as a form of company scrip; being utilised only in and around facilities owned and operated by Nanotrasen, particularly those in deep space. Employees here are paid in credits which are then usable in these facilities, and the currency is also utilised for intracompany requisitions and cargo purchases.

While the Credit is not legal tender outwith Nanotrasen, it doesn't stop it from being traded, at times, outwith the company. Some businesses close by to Nanotrasen facilities may accept it on an unofficial basis to encourage business from Nanotrasen employees, utilising other methods to convert it back to U¢ later down the line.

Nanotrasen offers services to convert between credits and unitary dollars; the conversion rate is usually around 100₦ : 1U¢.

## Spinward Stellar Ruble (S₽)

## Tiziran Rena (Ɍ/k)

## Mothic Ration Credit (₥)
The Mothic currency is unique in that it is, strictly speaking, not a currency at all; rather, it is technically a system of ration tickets or akin to a scrip. Where it becomes a currency in practical terms is in being used for discretionary purchases- giving it a facsimile of monetary value on the fleet. However, this value on the fleet does not translate to value outwith it; there is no official conversion rate for Ration Credits to any other galactic currency, but they are at times traded as such by moths between themselves.
