## Terran Unitary Dollar (Uni, U¢)
The Terran Unitary Dollar, or Uni for short, is the official currency of the Terran Federation, accepted in one form or another across the entirety of human space.

## Nanotrasen Credit (₦)
In Nanotrasen's various frontier holdings the Nanotrasen credit was adopted as a form of company scrip to make the company's internal economy easier to manage. Utilised only in and around facilities owned and operated by Nanotrasen, particularly those in deep space, this is also used to pay employees and for intracompany requisitions and cargo purchases.

While the Credit is not legal tender outwith Nanotrasen, it doesn't stop it from being traded at times, outwith the company's internal economy. Some businesses close by to Nanotrasen facilities may accept it on an unofficial basis to encourage business from Nanotrasen employees, utilising other methods to convert it back to U¢ later down the line.

Nanotrasen offers services to convert between credits and unitary dollars; the conversion rate is usually around 100₦ : 1U¢.

## Spinward Stellar Ruble (S₽)
The Spinward Stellar Ruble is the official currency of the Spinward Stellar Coalition, adopted following the collapse of the Third Soviet Union and the subsequent transition to a market economy. With the general difficulties imposed by a complete change in economic strategy, the Ruble is in dire straits as a currency, with high rates of inflation and general mistrust in its actual usefulness, which has led to the rise of alternative currencies across the Spinward Sector. In larger cities, this role is often taken by the Unitary Dollar, or occasionally Nanotrasen credits. In remote spaces, this may instead be a rough barter system, or a localised currency used only in a single area.

## Tiziran Rena (Ɍ/k)
The official currency of the Tiziran Empire and its various vassal and satellite states, the Rena (crown) is one of the enduring symbols of Imperial rule. Characterised by a complex system of subunits based on the Tiziran 4-finger hand, the Rena is generally considered to be a needlessly complex system to the more base-10 minded humans.

## Mothic Ration Credit (₥)
The Mothic currency is unique in that it is, strictly speaking, not a currency at all; rather, it is technically a system of ration tickets or akin to a scrip. Where it becomes a currency in practical terms is in being used for discretionary purchases- giving it a facsimile of monetary value on the fleet. However, this value on the fleet does not translate to value outwith it; there is no official conversion rate for Ration Credits to any other galactic currency, but they are at times traded as such by moths between themselves.
