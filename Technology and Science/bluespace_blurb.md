  Alright you sick bastards. I know you've been dodging my holocalls. Can't even get a goddamn SECOND from one of your "scientists" to hear me out on this, but I've had a massive god damn discovery and ONE OF YOU punk bastards needs to hear me out, alright? This shit is going to completely break the whole god damn smuggling bracket you've been cooking up for years, whether those Nanotrasen pansies like it or not.

  Hopefully I've got your attention by now. Name's Sebastian Cruz. I was a senior scientist with one of the Terragov research divisions before being recruited over to a Nanotrasen research outpost. Real far corner of the sector kind of deal. Farrrrrr away from any prying eyes. I don't know if you all had your eyes on this site, since we never even had a whisper of syndicate activity out here. It was a damn quiet place and nowhere near any inhabited sectors. That was the point. See, I got recruited because I came across something... out there. In a regular bluespace communication relay, I managed to tap into some kind of hidden blip on one of our more standard military outposts. 

  Next thing I knew, we had these... I don't even know what they call these damn things anymore. I heard someone call it a "blank body" once, so we'll go with that. It was like slimy pink gore shaped into the rough mockery of man. Damn things started crawling right out of the god damn woodwork. Course, the hardhats lit those bastards the hell up. Terragov called it a "once in a life-time accident", of course they couldn't pin the blame on a single damn person there. If you're familiar with those old damn supermatter cascades, think of it like that. One in a million mistake assuming you're not using a busted up defect crystal. But this... this was COMMUNICATIONS equipment that caused this. This could have happened by just tweaking a radio, and it broke loose all hell on site. Anyway, I'm getting besides myself. I had to withdraw from the campaign after what I saw that day, medical leave, honorable discharge.  All that jazz. Not 15 minutes later after I had my bag out the door, I got a pda message. Some Nanotrasen research head. He knew every damn thing about what happened on that site. He knew it better than I did. Said my findings were going to revolutionize the universe. Load of crock, I said. Then I saw the paycheck. I signed their damn hiring paperwork by the end of the day.

  Turns out, their understanding of bluespace is... well, it's damn near decades ahead of what terragov uses. I can tell you a hell of a lot more, but it ain't going to be cheap. I'm sending over my validation card to prove it. I know you want what I have, alright?

  Glad to hear someone's interested in listening.
My area of speciality is supposed to be in Bluespace Communications, but in reality bluespace is such a weird area of research that it hits just about every part of miniaturization science. Communications, circuits, teleportation, medical research, you name it, bluespace touches it somehow. But to explain what the fuck we came across, you have to understand that bluespace is *SUPPOSED* to be all about spatial distortions. It's a way to make space either a lot larger or a lot shorter. Like those wacky high tech bags Nanotrasen likes to show off. It uses bluespace to make space inside of a pretty standard backpack so it can hold an entire armory inside of effectively a handbag. Apparently, this lab at NT, right, they call that radial bluespace. Which, until that moment, is like, the ONLY kind of bluespace the rest of the universe knows about. Apparently, what I accidently "re-discovered" was something called "Linear Bluespace". Usually bluespace substations that they use in telecommunications get a short range radio signal, and then it takes a radial bluespace distance to all of it's targets, it shortens it to whoever needs the signal, so bam, millions of people hear your broadcast from halfway to Gartaaka-4.  But linear bluespace makes a thinner and thinner cone of that signal, and beams it straight to a single source.

And I fucked up. I fucked up BAD.

Turns out, my straight line for my radio broadcast? Yeah, I uhh, I bent it. Just a little bit. Off by about 2.19 degrees, I'd later learn. There's lots of like, bluespace lanes, they call them. You make a radial bluespace call and nobody really notices. Hit a bluespace lane with a linear bluespace message? You let everyone along that lane know exactly where you are, and what you're up to. And they hate that shit. They'll crawl out of whatever 4th dimensional shithole that they discovered this week and come right after your ass. Apparently, Nanotrasen has called this place the "nether". Hell is more like it. Albeit it's a LOT brighter and much, MUCH louder. It's like staring at a little girl's notebook, with only slightly less glitter.

Anyway, sorry, distracted. I basically broadcasted to an entire starsector that "There's humans here, we taste good, come and get us," to a small army of crayon eating TerraGov soldiers. Nanotrasen didn't hire me exactly for finding this out, but rather just to keep it a secret that it even fucking exists, right? But get this, I also learned that any of their basic ass teleporters that use this radial bluespace tech, they've got a HARD lock on what's inside of it. It's apparently EXTREMELY easy to figure out what's inside of those messages. That's why I'm communicating via physical media. Actual holotapes.

So, here's my pitch to you and your little corporate allies, alright? Kidnap me out of here, hook line and sinker, and I'll show you some real neat shit I've been cooking up. Untrackable teleportation tech. You could smuggle goods across the black market in a fraction of the time, no risk of dealing with Nanotrasen dogs, and if you do it right, you might even be able to do that same "demon dog whistle" trick I pulled off on that terragov sector on them, on purpose this time. Sides, if you screw up, it's not like you can't just unload on the little shits, right?

# Command Level Report
> Security Level Clearance: Bravo Glovebox
> 
> Attention: All Science Staff

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Commander Gutierrez here. Looks like your cover up of the LV-02891 site may have backfired. Your little lab rat just ran straight into the cat shelter. By and large, I should be admonishing each and every one of you for recklessly endangering our bleeding edge bluespace tech in the hands of some military lab assistant. Thankfully, it appears that the damage has been mitigated, as they were only made aware of our level 2 bluespace teleportation. Kind of a shame really, as if they'd dug a bit deeper, maybe he'd have realized that his "revelation" on bluespace science was basically the icing on the cake. That said, the combined forces of the spinward sector syndicate may have their hands on more advanced teleportation tech, but by all means, it's going to be far, FAR more dangerous than anything we're testing out on the flagship station. For now, we'll keep our eyes peeled. If anything comes of it, we may need to ramp up our retaliatory measures. But sometimes these kinds of problems solve themselves. Like being the sole producers of holotapes across the known galaxy. 

I will be talking with Senior Science Staff Keller about his unorthodox hiring practices privately.

That is all.

Gutierrez out.

...Seriously Keller, what the fuck.
