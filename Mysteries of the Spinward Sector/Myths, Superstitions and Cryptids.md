Superstitions, myths and legends are as numerous and varied as the stars in the sky, and every place has its own local flavors. Some, however, have ascended to such popularity to be widely known across most of the spacer community.


Bad omens or things that bring bad luck include:

*Wearing red on your first day at work
*The number 13
*Putting on a space helmet before the suit/Wearing a helmet without the suit
*Making preparations to disembark before docking is complete(i.e. unbuckling from the seat)
*Naming a ship after a living person
*Counting the stars out of a window
*Borrowing work equipment (typically for dangerous jobs)


## Space Whales

>"Extra-dimensional beings, far beyond our understanding. They stay hidden, clouding our minds because we are not worthy of them. But they revealed themselves to me, in a dream."
-Adelfos Truth, radio host of "The Truth Manifest"

These gargantuan beasts are said to be responsible for the mysterious disappearance of countless vessels. They are typically depicted as pitch black, occasionally with bright dots easily mistaken for distant stars. The vocalizations they use for echolocation are capable of scrambling radar equipment.  It is said the only time a space whale can be seen is when they open their enormous mouth to swallow entire stations whole.

There only exists one official report of a space whale attack that led to the disappearance of the HF Cassius in 2301, however the accuracy of this report has often been put into question and solid evidence of their existance is virtually nonexistant.

Although nowadays they are widely believed to be a hoax, space whales still permeate spacer culture. "Maybe it got swallowed by a whale" is a joke often heard whenever a tool gets lost and even the most skeptical of crewmembers can't help but feel a chill down their spine whenever they are gazing out to the vast nothingness of space and see a shadow move in the corner of their eye.


## Delta-Void Zones (also referred as DVZ, or Denied Voyage Zone)

>"Captain Sabersplit, as I knew him, was a bona fide hard-ass, but I could see he was restless.'Superstition or not, that place is trouble' he barked, 'Chart a course to go around'."
-"A Year On The Grand Nomad Fleet", Vedika Bakshi

Unexplained phenomena are not uncommon in some of the less traveled parts of known space, however certain sectors have garnered the reputation of being especially perilous, if not downright cursed. From ships becoming stranded due to unexplained mechanical failures to outright disappearing without a trace, ships traversing these areas seem to get into trouble more than usual. 

However several attempts at scuttling ships for insurance fraud in these areas have muddied the waters over how many of these incidents are indeed genuine, and navigators often avoid charting routes through them to avoid tempting fate, or at least to not upset some of the more superstitious crewmembers.

Some believe these factors caused something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, as these areas are generally avoided by anyone who isn't either desperate or up to no good.


## Lost Cosmonaut

>"I don't care what you think you saw, keep it to yourself before someone decides not to take any chances and throws you out of an airlock."
-A captain instructs a subordinate on how to deal with an alleged cosmonaut sighting

Appears as a man floating in space wearing a tattered, bloodied spacesuit and a helmet with a broken visor, yet an impenetrable darkness seems to always linger where his face would be. The Lost Cosmonaut is said to be portent of doom, visiting those who are in mortal danger or on their way to certain death.

He is believed to be the spirit of the first person to become stranded in space after his tether malfunctioned during routine EVA maintenance. His name has been lost to time, and his remains were never found.


## The Flotilla of the Damned (or The Flood)

>"Of course they don't want you to talk about it. The military did a lot weird shit with AI, it was only a matter of time before something got out of control."
-Adelfos Truth, radio host of "The Truth Manifest"

According to the legend the Flood is a seemingly endless fleet of vessels commanded by an experimental AI gone rogue whose only goal is to expand its armada for no known purpose. It does so by luring ships with distress signals, enslaving the crews and taking control of the vessels it lures in.

At one point the myth of the Flood exploded to such popularity that it started to cause major issues: ships started ignoring distress signals out of fear, sometimes with fatal consequences.
Because of this many companies started cracking down on these rumors and just casual mentions of the Flood became enough to risk disciplinary action. This move was largely successful in making the myth fall to relative obscurity, but it also fanned the flames of the more zealous fringe groups who saw it as proof of a conspiracy to hide the truth.
