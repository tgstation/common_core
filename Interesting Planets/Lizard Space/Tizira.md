# Tizira: The Jewel of the Empire
While the Lizard Empire has come to encompass many planets over the course of its existence, none have been able to attain the level of beauty that is attributed to the capital, Tizira (Life-Mother). A rugged, arid planet, Tizira has small, shallow seas, and limited farmland, with most of the planet's surface being covered in vast badlands and savannahs, as well as deserts and small mountain ranges. In the more humid areas near the oceans, particularly around the equator, rainforests and tropical jungles thrive, acting as a home to an incredible range of biodiversity, as well as being the native homeland of the Tree Lizards. Additionally, in the northernmost and southernmost regions of the planet, temperate forests exist, as well as marshlands and rolling green hills. At the poles, a small band of tundra exists, before the polar ice caps. These areas are sparsely habited, as they are far from the natural habitat of the lizards.

Abundant natural resources include high-quality iron, silver, coal, salt, and hydrocarbons suitable for use as spacecraft fuel, resulting in the capital having a thriving material economy. In addition, the planet is host to most lizard corporations and companies, and has become a large tourist destination for lizards and non-lizards alike. However, many visitors find the atmosphere on the planet oppressive once they arrive- owing to the large military presence and generally stuffiness of the local populace when compared with the more open colonies.

Tizira possesses three moons. The largest of its moons, Atrakor ("Night Sky Lord" in High Draconic) was famously bombarded by the TerraGov Expeditionary Corps during one of lizardkind's many wars with humanity, giving the Lord his distinctive scar. Colonies exist on all three moons, harvesting valuable minerals to sustain the lizard economy. A number of orbital habitats exist too, though their quality is dubious and critics of the government accuse them of using them as offworld slums to house the poor and destitute out of sight and out of mind.

Tourist Information:
* The capital of Tizira is the city of Zagoskeld, translating to "Great Sea's Edge" from High Draconic. Its metropolitan area is home to around 1/16th of the planet's population. The city is home to the Imperial Family, whose palace overlooks the bay and is a popular tourist destination in the city. It's located on the Zagosk, or Great Sea, and as expected is also a major port city for intraplanetary trade.
* Tizira is home to around 10 billion lizardpeople, making it the Empire's most populous planet. A further 500 million live in orbital habitats and in colonies on its three moons.
* The urban density is highest around the oceans, with settlements further from water being smaller and less densely populated. Rural areas have survived the advancement to the space age, unlike on Earth.
* The many wars of lizardkind have resulted in much of the ancient architecture of the planet being lost or ruined. The few remaining well preserved sites are now strictly guarded as cultural heritage sites. Zagoskeld's old city is one of the best preserved areas of Medieval Lizard architecture, and the Imperial Palace is a key example of this style.
* While High Draconic is the official language of the Lizard Empire, officially around 2500 languages are recognised as still living by Lizard scholars. Strong cultural divides still cause issues for the central government, even centuries after unification.

## Oskmarzel: Atrakor Shines Upon Oskmarzel

Factoids:
* Oskmarzel was considered an unlikely contender for the unification of Tizira. While it was never a weak player in Anceldish or wider Tiziran politics, it was far from the strongest; were it not for the Valyse inheritance, it is likely that Tiziran history would have gone very differently.

## Pelatakarna: The Iron Mountains

Factoids:
* Pelatakarna is an oddity amongst Tizira's former nations, being quite cold as far as permanently inhabited regions go. The reason for this is its incredibly rich iron mines- prior to space colonisation, Pelatakarna was the most iron-rich Tiziran nation by population, and provided much of the Old World's supply of iron and steel.
* Pelatakarna is considered somewhat of a backwater as far as Tiziran former nations go. The Karna people are, as a collective, deeply religious, agrarian, and homely.
* Pelatakarna is a small nation, with only four cities breaching the 100,000 population threshold: of these the capital, Kiselle, is the most important, being a major centre of industry, mostly around the nation's primary export of construction steel and metal products, although it's also a hub of Tizira's financial businesses and computer science.
* During the snowiest period of the year which makes up approximately 4 Tiziran months at the end of the year, much of Pelatakarna shuts down. During these periods, the Karna take an extended holiday, and spend the time at home, in front of the fire with their families, enjoying traditional food and drink and generally having a merry time. This gives the Karna a reputation internationally as lazy and listless.

The lands of the former Grand Ducal Confederation of Pelatakarna have, going back millenia, been sleepy. One of the few Tiziran regions to experience frequent snowfall, the ice-capped Iron Mountains were not an attractive place for settlers throughout history; or at least, that would have been the story, were it not for their rich veins of iron. This made the mountains a lucrative prize, but actually exploiting these resources was a challenge, and so the population within the peaks would be so small as to be practically nonexistant throughout Tizira's early history. Into the medieval period, however, as demand for iron grew and mining technology advanced, extraction from the Iron Mountains became not only possible, but crucial to the development of Anceld's many states. Following this, a number of intrepid frontiersmen from nearby regions began to expand into the mountains, founding settlements and laying the foundations of a new culture to emerge: the Karna people. Within a few centuries, the various dukes of the Karna people agreed to confederation under the Grand Ducal Confederation of Pelatakarna, and a crucial Anceldish nation that would stand the test of time to unification was born.

As might be expected from snow-covered peaks, Pelatakarna has a low population, mostly clustered around the former confederation's major cities, although with a large rural agrarian population, who make their living growing hardy fruits and ranching cave crickets. The Karna people trend towards tradition; with one of the highest religious population of any former nation on Tizira, as well as a style of building that seems to have fallen directly out of Tizira's pre-industrial era, they pride themselves on upholding much of what the rest of Tizira has left behind, especially in the countryside. Naturally, the rest of the population of Tizira tends to view them as backwards and stuck in the past, unwilling to adapt to the new realities of the modern day.

## Minofera: 

## Valys: A Nation of Two Halves

Factoids:
* Valys was, prior to the Valyse Inheritance, considered to be the strongest Anceldish nation, and was on track to eventually unite Tizira itself. This fact is not lost on the Valyse, who trend jingoistic and imperialist politically; although they mostly turn this outwards these days, being a stronghold for Sumalist thought and loyalists through and through to the parliament who uphold it.
* Valyse culture was and is a very strong influence across the Anceld, having been a nexus of artistic development throughout the middle ages and giving rise to Tizira's largest film industry in the modern period.

## Parseld: An Escape from Everything

Factoids:
* The breadbasket of Tizira, the former Parselder republic produces a truly incredible amount of food. Additionally, many Tiziran staples originated here, including

The discovery of Tizira's Parseld in the Era of Discovery was a major upset to the balance of power in the Anceld, with many of the leading nations there seeking to expand into the new, virgin territory found across the Zagosk.

After winning its independence, the former territory of the Valyse Parseld took a new mantle: the Parseld Republic, ready to stand as a beacon of liberty and hope on Tizira. As time went on and industrialisation continued to sweep Tizira, many of those made redundant by the new technologies went to the Parseld in search of a better life, and brought their extensive knowledge of farming and craftsmanship with them to its fertile lands. Within a few decades, Parselder food production reached impressive peaks, and it never stopped growing from there.

From its initial founding under agrarian ideals, and subsequent expansion under the labour of farmers might inform you, life in the Parseld has remained defiantly agrarian in the face of Tizira's moderisation. Much of its large landmass is sparsely populated, with small-town living and farming being the order of business. Near the coast, the fight to industrialisation was lost, however, and major cities stand, taking advantage of the vast wealth of resources of the continent.
