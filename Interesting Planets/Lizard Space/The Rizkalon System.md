## Rizkalon System
Almighty Rizaklon, the Sun-Queen, lifegiver and mother to all. The Rizkalon system is similar to Sol in many ways, acting as the centre of the vast lizard empire, as well as being the most densely populated and industrialised system under lizardkind's umbrella. It's also the safest region of lizard space due to the presence of the Imperial Navy.

Interestingly, Rizkalon also shows relatively extensive precursor activity in the further reaches, dated millenia back.

### Sulya: Lizardkind's First Colony

#### Fact Sheet:
* Classified as a Snow World, Sulya is in the grips of a significant ice age. Forests dominate the central habitable band of the planet, with significant geothermal activity under the surface. Volcanoes are common, as are hot springs, and much of the population of the planet is clustered around these regions of warmth.
* Sulya's capital is Serebin, founded as part of the initial wave of colonisation of the planet. The city has a population of around 15 million.
* Sulya is home to one of the "Natural Wonders of the Tiziran Empire", Lake Urayah- fed into by a number of smaller hot spring tributaries, the entire miles-wide lake is naturally heated to a pleasant temperature. The lake is additionally located at the foot of the Great Smoking Pillar, Sulya's largest active volcano, which has been in a constant state of mild eruption for 300 years. The shores of Lake Urayah are home to a number of resorts and tourist attractions, and the volcano itself has attracted some religious significance amongst the Tiziran pantheon as "a symbol of Merina's gifts".
* Lizards seeking to venture beyond the heated areas close to the hot springs need to account for their body's lack of natural heating, a problem which has been overcome by use of heated jumpsuits, utilising electrical heating to keep the body warm. In settlements, heated water from the springs (or from geothermal wells) is piped under streets to maintain the temperature, as well as distributing hot water to the population for heating their homes.

The closest planet to Tizira, Sulya was Lizardkind's first colony- over 700 years ago, the first colonists landed on Sulya to set up a new life there. In the 7 centuries since, Sulya has, despite being in many ways inhospitable to lizard life, grown to become a key part of the Lizard Empire, and to encompass a population of around 500 million. Life on its snowy surface is idyllic in many ways, with excellent sights, natural hot springs to relax in, and pleasantly snowy weather. As a result, it has become a popular tourist destination, with ski resorts, spas and health retreats being particularly popular establishments.

In the Tiziran pantheon, Sulya is one of Tizira's sisters, hailed as the Goddess of Hearth, Home, the Harvest, Cooking and, somewhat oddly, Athletes and Competition. The reason for this connection seems to have been lost to time, but it is still observed: the annual Imperial Games on Tizira is still dedicated in spirit to Sulya, although this is only lip service due to the secularisation of the state.

### Merina: The Salt, the Sand, and the Baking, Baking Sun

#### Fact Sheet:
* Merina is a sun-scorched wasteland. No life remains on its dried-up exterior, and no observable hydrosphere remains on its surface. In addition, its atmosphere is thin.
* Research suggests that at one point, Merina was similar in climate to Tizira, but that some calamity in the distant past resulted in the planet's magnetosphere becoming too weak to sustain a proper atmosphere. For a long time it has been referred to as "the Lost Child of the Sun-Queen", and is traditionally part of the Tiziran pantheon as being the stillborn twin of Tizira herself.
* Merina has substantial mineral wealth, which is mostly funneled into the industries around Atrakor.

As another planet close to Tizira, Merina has long fascinated lizardkind. However, once the space-age came, and lizardkind was finally able to see her surface in person, it became clear that Merina did not have the fortune that Tizira did. The sun-scorched dunes, salt flats, and cracked-mud wastelands that comprise the surface tell the tale of a dead planet, and archaeological and environmental assays show that Merina did, at one point, sustain simple life. And yet, disaster had clearly struck the planet, weakening its magnetosphere and allowing it to fall to the baking heat of Rizkalon. The planet does, however, still bear significant material wealth, which has led it to become a major target of industrial expansion under the Imperial regime. Metals and gases from Merina today provide a significant portion of the Rizkalon system's industrial capacity.

As the dead sister of Tizira, it is perhaps fitting that Merina is regarded as the Goddess of Time and Death in the Tiziran pantheon- oddly fitting, even, given that the Tizirans did not truly behold the devastation on Merina's surface before declaring her a Goddess. Note that the domain of Death does not extend to being the God of the Dead- that honour falls to Atrakor, as the protector of lost souls.

### Viomea: Scorched Remnants of an Empire Lost to Time
* Viomea is located on a similar orbital trajectory to Merina. The two pass alarmingly close to each other at times.
* Widespread settlement of Viomea is impossible, despite the inherent value of the planet, as the environment is just too inhospitable to sustain long-term life.

Viomea is the third planet from Rizkalon, and is close enough in orbital patterns to be seen as a sister to Merina. Like her sister, she is extremely inhospitable, though for different reasons. The atmosphere on Viomea has an alarming quantity of chlorine, leading to an extremely acidic environment. The surface of Viomea is defined by four main characteristics:

* Extremely acidic water, including open bodies, rivers, and rain.
* Extreme temperatures, as high as 70 degrees celsius in some areas.
* Constant poor weather, including extreme storms and winds, frequent hurricanes, and near constant tornadoes (which freqeuently become "acidspouts" due to meeting open bodies of water).
* A dense, hardy jungle of silicon-based plants, which manage to survive their hostile environment.

Understandably, this would normally turn off would be settlers and adventurers, but Viomea has opportunity lurking behind the danger: the planet was, at some point in its history, used as a ship graveyard by a (presumably extinct) species. These precursor vessels represent an extremely lucrative source of wealth from Viomea's surface- if they can be reached. As such, brave (or foolhardy) lizards make a living making excursions to salvage what they can from these ancient hulks, selling the salvage on for research. The Tiziran government sponsors such expeditions via a state-owned corporation, known as the Viomea Salvage Corporation.

Viomea is another key part of the Tiziran pantheon, taking the position of the God of War, Soldiers and Victory. The Imperial flagship has also taken this name due to the obvious connection.
