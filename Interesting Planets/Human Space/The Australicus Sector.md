# The Australicus Sector
> "Course, once you get past the spiders, and the weather, and all that stuff... yeah, it's a fair dinkum place, really."

A sector in name only, the Australicus Sector is a subdivision of the Trailward Near Rim once used as a penal colony, and today known galaxywide for its hostile conditions, dangerous wildlife, and friendly populace.

In terms of habitability, the Australicus sector is considered a minor miracle, with 18 fully habitable planets spread across its stars. Such unprecedented density of habitability, however, comes at a cost- the planets are home to an incredible array of flora and fauna, most of which wants you dead. While the Australican spiders are the most famous inhabitants, special mention also must be given to such species as the Kinross Redhead Snake, the River Snapper, and especially to the Drop Bear.

Constituting a federation of 9 stars (Kookaburra, Booderee, Adelaide, Elizabeth, King's Star, New Pembroke, Kinross, Topside and Zealandia), alongside a number of outlying territories, the Australicus sector has its own legislature, which represent it as a federal entity at the TerraGov Senate.

### Kookaburra
The capital system of the Australicus Sector, Kookaburra is considered to be the least hostile of the systems of the Australicus Sector. It is, naturally, host to the capital planet of the sector, Union, alongside 2 other habitable planets, all of which have mild climates and generally harmless fauna.

### Booderee
Barely qualifying as a star system, Booderee consists of its central star, with one singular planet in orbit- Crestpoint. Despite this, it's relatively densely populated, having a higher population than larger systems such as Topside and Kinross.

### Adelaide

### Elizabeth

### King's Star

### New Pembroke
The site of the first settlement within the Australicus Sector, New Pembroke today has the honour of being the most populous of the Australican star systems, with its four habitable planets being home to around a fifth of the Sector's overall population between them. The capital, Arthurstown, sits on the golden shores of Albion's largest sea, and is a popular tourist destination within the sector.

### Topside
The most sparsely populated of the stars of the federation, Topside's three planets are each essentially uninhabitable by normal means. The most hospitable, Earlmont, beats the other two by actually having a breathable atmosphere- however, the baking heat of Topside scorching its sands makes the surface practically unlivable. Instead, the inhabitants of Earlmont dig into the ground to construct settlements, such as the planet's (and system's) capital, Copperhead.

### Zealandia
Zealandia is the proverbial black sheep of the Australicus Federation. Culturally distinct and relatively independent, the Zealanders can only barely be considered Australican. Similarly to Kookaburra, the climate and fauna of the various habitable planets are mild and generally safe, and Zealandia has therefore taken the title of the Australican breadbasket for its agricultural output.

The capital of the Zealandia system is Lancaster, located on the planet Waterloo.
