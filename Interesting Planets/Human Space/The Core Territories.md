## TerraGov Core Territories

The Core Territories are those systems closest to Sol, split between the inner and outer core. This region is well patrolled and generally safe, with a number of important systems scattered throughout.

Officially, the core starts at the borders of the Sol System, and ends at the start of the Close Rim. Alpha Centauri is the closest Core Territory system to Sol.

### Adasta: The Second World of the Empire

#### Fact Sheet:
* Adasta has rapidly become the largest industrial centre in Alpha Centauri, making it one of the most industrialised planets in human space. Though it does not currently rival the Moon or Saturn (although it is close), its current trajectory of expansion suggests that in less than a century it will surpass them.
* This industrialisation is prompted by an incredible mineral wealth. Ore deposits lie near or at the surface, with massive excavations and open pits pulling up billions of UÂ¢ worth of ore daily. Unfortunately, however, the planet lacks plasma, which makes its ability to keep up with technological advancements limited without imports from Mars, or further afield.
* The shipyards of Adasta are colossal, and the TerraGov navy has plans to set up facilities for the production of the next-generation of capital vessels there- much to the chagrin of the corporations operating on and around the Moon, who are presently responsible for the expansion of the TerraGov navy.
* Adasta has a yearly "dark season", wherein the cloud cover becomes so thick and severe that the sun is essentially blocked out for several months at a time. This is known as the Long Night to the inhabitants of Adasta, and it's when Adasta City truly comes alive.

Adasta was one of the greatest finds during Humanity's surveying of the Alpha Centauri system. An Earth-like planet, Adasta was perfect for human colonisation, with passive fauna and edible flora, and a quite survivable, if cold and significantly wet, climate. These conditions have precipitated an explosion of activity, bringing millions of settlers in the centuries since humans first set foot on its surface. Now, it's the main population centre of Alpha Centauri, as well as one of the most populated planets in human space, with well over 8 billion people calling it home.

Adasta, as is perhaps expected for a planet of its importance, well represented in the senate- in fact, it is overrepresented relative to its population. This is perceived by many to be a deliberate choice to avoid a repeat of the disastrous Martian revolution, particularly as Adasta is now critical to maintaining humanity's industrial and military sectors.

As far as life on Adasta is concerned, the planet is considered by many to be "Earth, but darker and rainier". Modern industrial techniques and technology allow the planet's industry to run cleanly, giving a remarkably low pollution relative to its industrial capacity. While the planet may lack some of the old-world charm of Earth, it more than makes up for it with its modern city design. They say that Adasta City has humanity's best nightlife, as well as some of the best quality of life anywhere in human space. The constant battering rain is a mere inconvenience when every street has a cover.

The twin moons of Adasta, Romulus and Remus, have become true industrial heartlands in much the same way as Earth's own moon, with major shipyards and manufacturing facilities.

### Astarte: A Home in the Clouds

#### Fact Sheet:
* Astarte is another of Alpha Centauri's densely populated planets- a fact that might be surprising given it's a Gas Giant.
* The planet is named for Astarte, the Caananite and Phoenician Goddess of war, romance, and power. This name was picked due to the planet's pinkish hue at sunsets, first observed during initial exploration efforts of Alpha Centauri.
* The upper atmosphere on Astarte is surprisingly breathable, having an atmospheric composition only slightly different to that of Earth. This allows the planet's gas cities to remain open air.
* For a gas giant, Astarte offers a surprising array of biodiversity, with flying animals "swimming" through the upper atmosphere.

Astarte began its life under human influence in much the same way Saturn did- being targeted for potential gas extraction. However, fate would carry the planet in a different direction, as details of its atmospheric composition were discovered. With a composition similar to that of Earth, the planet was functionally useless for large scale skimming, but a different opportunity presented itself- atmospheric shipyards. Offering crews the comfort to work on large ships without requiring EVA gear, the planet became popular for this purpose, with the technology of gas cities being pioneered here. As time went on, the inherent beauty of the planet started to draw another, different, clientele- the rich. Astarte is now one of the most expensive places to live in human space, particularly around its capital of Ishtar, which has gained a reputation to rival Paris as "the city of love". Ludicrously expensive sky-manors and apartment blocks now make up a large portion of the gas-cities of Astarte.

The gas cities of Astarte are sprawling structures made up of a number of colossal interconnected platforms, held at a steady height by atmospheric thrusters. The number of platforms per city varies- Ishtar, the largest, is made up of over 200. Transport between platforms is usually accomplished via flying vessels, though magrail links also offer connections between the more populated regions.

### Harvest: Humankind's Breadbasket

#### Fact Sheet:
* The capital city of Harvest is Carter's Prospect, which is also the largest city on the planet, boasting a population of 750,000. The city is particularly green, with numerous parks and open spaces, and very little of the city has buildings above a few storeys.
* The planet as a whole has a population of 6 million, spread across the extremely fertile central band. Fewer live in the vast forests of the north and south.
* Harvest is an Agriworld, with an economy very strongly based upon farming. Food from Harvest feeds humanity throughout the galaxy, with millions of tonnes being produced per annum. Other economic sectors include mining, logging and tourism.
* Owing to its history as a settlement of Biosustain, the Harvester dialect that has emerged there is regarded as a German regional dialect, although with significant alteration due to additional migration through the centuries since.

Harvest, in the Demeter system, is one of Humanity's more important colonies, due to the incredible fertility of the soil there. Classified as an Eden planet, Harvest has a perfect atmosphere for humanity, as well as a remarkably mild climate. By all accounts, it was a perfect planet for humankind to settle, and humans have taken excellently to life there. The population is austere, hard-working and communal, and the people pride themselves on this fact, viewing offworlders with a degree of suspicion. Rural areas are dominated by colossal farms, producing huge quantities of food crops, as well as large amounts of animal products. In urban areas, food processing plants are common, turning the harvest from the countryside into high quality products to be shipped across the galaxy.

### The Locker: Throw Away the Key
> "Welcome to your new life, inmates."

#### Fact Sheet:
* If you've found your way to the Locker, you've fucked up somewhere along the line.
* A home for the worst the galaxy has to offer, the Locker is where those deemed too dangerous to be held in any standard prison are sent.
* Perhaps the most famous inhabitant of the Locker, Sterling Q. Atamann, the former Archmagister of the Wizard's Federation, is kept in a special "null-cell" within the highest security portion of the prison.

Located in a remote system somewhere on the fringes of the TerraGov core, the Locker (as it is colloquially known) is humanity's highest security prison, for humanity's worst criminals. Built into an asteroid within a nebula and guarded by a detachment of the TerraGov navy, the prison houses a diverse range of evil types: mass murderers, war criminals, the criminally insane; they all find their way to the Locker. Once you're there, you're not leaving. In over 150 years of operation, nobody has (officially) successfully escaped the Locker- though many have tried.

Commissioned in 2405 as a replacement for the previous Jump Three Incarceration Facility, the Locker is divided into 3 categories: Supermax, Hypermax, and Psych-Detention. Given the Locker is only used for criminals who are serving a life sentence *and* are so dangerous to society that they must be entirely separated from it, these distinctions are more geared towards liberties granted to the prisoners: visitation rights, luxuries, etc.

### Idyllus: Paradise by the Sunset Lights

#### Fact Sheet:
* Located in the trinary Marinus System, Idyllus is an ocean resort world famed the galaxy over. Its pale sands, shallow and warm azure oceans, lush jungles and mangrove swamps, tropical climate, and peaceful fauna make it an ideal location for vacationing- and for the massive resorts that have sprung up to accommodate those visitors.
* The oceans on Idyllus really are shallow. At their deepest, they bottom out at around 50 feet deep, and the average depth is closer to 25 feet. The seabeds are alive with coral and plant life, with abundant fish in the crystal-clear waters above.
* As most of the surface of Idyllus is covered with water, floating platforms and submerged structures are used to expand beyond the small islands. Popular amongst humanity's richest are submanors beneath Idyllus' azure waves. Those with less money (though still enough to spend on holiday homes on a resort world) may opt for a floating home, either in isolation or as part of a settlement. The very richest have private islands.
* The signature animal of Idyllus is the Idyllic Seaskater, a massive ray-like creature that is found throughout its oceans. Notably sensitive to water conditions, attempts to keep it in captivity in aquariums away from Idyllus have lead to little besides dead seaskaters and disappointed marine biologists.
* A holiday for two to the KP Marine Hotel and Resort is one of the top prizes available via the NT Corporate Perks system.
* The trinary nature of the Marinus System makes for some wonderful sunsets on Idyllus, bathing the planet in three different colours at once.

The jewel of the Marinus System, Idyllus is an ocean world with what can only be described as the *perfect* conditions for vacationing. Between its climate, views, ecological features, and ease of access, Idyllus attracts billions of holidayers per year to its pale sands. Additionally, it's become a very popular location for second homes, with many of mankind's richest and most elite buying up property on its surface, from seahomes to submanors, and even private islands.

The largest settlement on Idyllus is Scheria, named for Homer's utopia. Boasting a population of 8 million, Scheria is famed as one of the most expensive places in human space. Many fashion houses and luxury dealers have branches there, as well as a number of the galaxy's top chefs having restaurants amongst its streets. For the less rich, cities such as Thebes or Menelaus might be more accessible, offering an urban experience similar to those found in island nations of the 21st century, and with a more down-to-earth permanent population as well.
